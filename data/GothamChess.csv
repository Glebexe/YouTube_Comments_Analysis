344,"Hello. So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is. I am not trying to force my belief down people's throats. It's your choice whether you want to accept it. Please read the whole text.

So, a question: Do you think you are a good person? If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, watched adult material? All of those are sins and anyone who sinned is not good(on God's standard). You, I and most( most because babies don't sin, and maybe specifically mentally Ill people) purely human beings have violated God's moral law. Since God is just, He can't let sin go just like that.

So is there any hope? Yes, there is. Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned. 

The reason why blood must be spilled for forgiveness of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the sacrifice of animals were enough to temporarily cover some sins. (it did not allow forgiveness of sins, unlike Jesus's, it only temporarily covered them). Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. Jesus was buried and rose again. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus's spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our Salvation. And then your sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved.    See:  Romans 3:1 , Romans 3:23 , Romans 5:12 , Romans 6:23 , Romans 5:8-9, Romans 10:9-10 , Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV, John 3:16 KJV, Leviticus 17:11 ,  Ephesians 1:7 , Colossians 1:20, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 .",0

388,"Game #1 - I normally play the Closed Sicilian countering the Sicilian, which is Knight to QB3.  In response to N-QB3 by black, white usually fianchetto's the king's bishop, and then Smyslov would play N-KB3, with the idea of eventually putting the Bishop on K3, Q on K2 and putting the B on h6.  After castling the p on f2 can eventually lead to a push attack on f4. Yes, I know, sorry I mixed Algebraic and Descriptive Notation.  Sometimes I do that with memorization of the KJV vs. other translations.
Good job to take some time thinking about your moves when playing Levy!

405,"Dear Gothamchess,

I wanted to reach out and express my heartfelt appreciation for your incredible 31st episode on ""How to win at Chess."" Your expertise and engaging teaching style have been instrumental in improving my chess skills, and I am truly grateful for the knowledge you share.

I have a suggestion that I think would add an interesting and captivating element to your future episodes. It would be fascinating if you could consider analyzing games from countries with limited resources and chess development, such as Zimbabwe. Exploring the strategies and tactics employed by players facing unique challenges could provide a refreshing and intuitive perspective for your audience. Not only would it be entertaining, but it could also shed light on the ingenuity and resourcefulness exhibited by chess enthusiasts in less privileged settings.

Once again, thank you for your dedication to promoting the game of chess and for the incredible content you produce. Your passion and expertise are truly inspiring, and I eagerly await your future episodes.

Warmest regards,
Duratendaishe",0

947,Make a tutorial for this opening please 😭,0
948,"Wow

I didn't know my country had gms(brazil)
Good to know:)",1
949,"I do the same in my games (as a 950-1000 lichess), start with rightmost pawn up two steps (h/a pawn depending on black or white) and then at some fitting point always putting the right knight to the right border, one spot below the h/a pawn. The opening really does not matter, since the elo rating will automatically put you in a spot, where you have a fun and challenging 50/50 percent win loss rate. So why not go way off from theory road into clown town",0
950,"22:20 damn, 6 hours of blitz in a row",0
951,if hes not a cheater then he is a alien,0

995,"Wot if... the oppening is actually good, and being up a full bishop in early and mid game is better than the prospect of being up a rook for a bishop in the end game?

996,"Ding Liren's secret training account.  Watch out, Gukesh!",0
997,"19:00 for us intermediates it helps to run the calculation a bit more, how is re7 effective against white's nf5 plan to fork the rook and pawn on g7? Is the idea you just move the rook to f7 and stay solid?",0
998,"Brandon Jacobson has changed his description to ""Kramnik please notice me""
🤣",2
999,"Yes, he is 100% a cheater. It is a lot easier to cheat when one is a grandmaster, as it is not needed to cheat on all moves, he can find normal moves by himself, and only need help for finding critical moves.",0
1000,No this is just normal. 95% of you are retuards even if you dont think so.,0
1001,"What is Danya's take on this? I mean, he played 500 games against this guy and ""farmed"" him. I really like Danya, SOMEHOW I have a weird feeling watching him play an alleged cheater for so long though. I hope they didn't ""test stuff"" if ykwim.",0

1004,"chess people all infected with cheating suspicions since carlsen started to just randomly accuse everyone he looses against now its new fashion, every player who just accuses without proof has lost all of my respect and should be sentenced if not chess will die",0
1005,This is a known gambit which this player obviously got very comfortable playing. My question is why a player would keep taking the rook after losing even a few games?!,0
1006,"Well damn, the cheating gamers are infiltrating the chess world now? Crazy",0
1007,"A: Someone coded a program to cheat quickly

B: Magnus(least probable)

1012,"To be honest Knight G7 (second game) was something i was looking at as well. You remove the defender of the black knight, and thus at the very least it's a pawn that you took, and at the best, you are opening up the opponent's king.",0
1013,This has to be an actually skilled chess player using an engine in a novel way. Maybe they press a button and it makes a hacked mouse make the best move instantly.,0
1014,"How likely is it that some GM tried to memorize and use obscure surprise lines no one uses to have an advantage in blitz? If both players have roughly the same ELO, but one of them has analyzed the game before playing it and memorized like 10+ moves while his opponent is forced to calculate his moves during the game, wouldn't it give a bigger advantage in a short game than having 2 extra points of material?",0
1015,"this person came forward on r/chess explaining the situation. I recommend their post titled ""It's me. Viih_sou"" posted by the account u/extreme-ad-6490",0
1016,"Cheating in chess must be kind of easy if you are getting sick of chess anyway. Outside of the chess world does anyone really care if you got caught cheating at chess? Within the chess world it's like being branded a traitor, the worst thing you can do. In the real world I doubt people would even care. Well in the US anyway where chess isn't very mainstream.",0
1017,It was GM Brandon Jacobson. He wrote a lengthy reddit post on r/chess and says he did not cheat.,0
1018,"Could a GM not get better at one opening that's played over and over again? Could you or another gm try this opening 100 games in a row and see how far you take it? If Magnus and hikaru win with bongclouds, do they deserve to be called cheaters?",4
1019,"It’s Brandon Jacobson, and he seems pretty pissed about the ban. He just posted on Reddit.",0
1020,"Sorry, but even Magnus would have a worst score against Naro if that were all he played",0
1021,How can someone cheat in such a fast time control .. if he is using a separate software how does he enter it into that.. does he have like the engine on in another account ??,0
1022,"Doesn't seem like a cheater, because why would a cheater play over 70 games 3 - 9 AM knowing your going to win. It is either their really good or just a bot, no inbetweens.",0

1028,wild guess: maybe an AI supported tool/bot? would be a sensible explanation for the speed at least.,0
1029,I guess this proves all humans suck at chess.,0

1031,Viih Tube? 😂,0
1032,Ngl I love that Naroditsky plays all-nighters! Shows he still loves the game!,0
1033,rook gets less play at the start of the game so its less valuable than bishop or knight. rook seems to be quite sluggish in its moving when there is lot of other pieces also.,3
1034,how can you be so dumb to sacrifice a piece in the opening (i mean not because it's dumb to loose a piece but it's soo dumb to do it and then win all of a sudden against a player like Daniel),0
1035,"haven't seen anyone calling out it could be an alpha zero style AI being tested, not sure up to what point that is a possibility, but as far as i recall most of those alpha zero games had some really weird tough to play moves and then some very easy calls for a GM, which could make sense?",0

1048,"What if this was some kind of experiment where this GM learned a load of robot moves and practiced it on Danya? Otherwise, what bot plays like this?  Interesting games to say the least.",0
1049,I have literally seen this every time except my opponent is 500+,0
1050,"I bet that they were practicing the opening.. for 6 hours..

1052,And he sacrificed his ROOK in every game!,0
1053,I have stopped playing chess too many cheaters,1
1054,"It could be a new Deep Learning Algorithmn someone cooked up. It learned the opening, won enough times with it so it stuck around.
It isn't optimized so it wont always find the perfect move each time, but it will still outplay a human the majority of the time. Especially because this opening leads to a number of plays basically nobody has experience or theoretical knowledge of. The machine has the upper hand in experience.

My guess.",0
1055,considering that daniel is top 3 in the world at 3+0 chess i would put my money on well done cheating.,0
1056,"""viih sou"" sounds like ""vinicius souza"" or some sort of name like that",0

1062,I wonder if its a new learning AI bruteforcing a new opening.,0
1063,"whenever i win a GM, i get banned, this is how it's going, GM cant lose.",3
1064,maybe we need to analyze this opening with stock-fish more.... It might actually throw theory out the window and prove to be solid.,0
1065,Or maybe this guy is trying to invent a new opening/gambit ... he is actually trying hard for this opening ... give this dude some credits,0
1066,if naroditsky fixed his sleeep cycle there wont be any cheaters,0

1071,Isnt the last game right at the end a win for white? he has rc8 kd7 and nf5 forking king and queen and after taking the rook and be2 are both attacked leaving a winning advantage?,1
1072,4 seconds into the game: white has been up 2 points for a very long time.,1
1073,How can the person be verified as GM but still remain private?,0

1077,"SINCERE QUESTION: let's say you create an opening or create super idiotic black moves opening that literally nobody plays and around the 4th or 5th move you memorize (like most professional ""over the board"" chess players do) ALL the best chess-moves the engine can come up with after move 4 or move 5  ... thus it is all inside your head now ... all this memorization could take days to prepare BUT you did it ""fair & square"" .... But you get FLAGGED for it because it is ""impossible"" to know the chess engine moves JUST LIKE PROFESSIONALS do when preparing an official ""over the board"" match? ... Are there ANY GMs that ""never"" used engines to prepare a match?  REALLY?",0
1078,Whats with all the comments about kramnik?,1
1079,"Crazy idea... if both sides play the same opening to that extent every time, perhaps a cheater could pre-compute enough viable mid-games the opponent could take such that an engine would be fast enough to take over when they ran out of moves?  Deviation from the expected mid-game would require some human assistance, same if the engine wasn't quick enough with a response.  Plausible?",0
1080,"To be fair, if you play the same weird opening for dozens, if not hundreds of games and probably even analyze it with an engine, you will simply know it better than everybody else. So you may look like an engine, but in reality it's just experience. Also, if your opponent gifts you a rook for a bishop on move 3, you might be prone to making mistakes / inaccuracies more commonly, thinking ""what an idiot, losing the rook so early"", rather than focusing on playing solidly. Especially in blitz chess, where you can play pretty much anything anyways.

Like in soccer / football, where one team loses a player to an injury or a red card and still wins, because they play more energetically, compensating for having one less player, while the other team stumbles on their high horse, playing more relaxed, since they have an additional player anyways, falling to a ""what's the worst that could happen?""-kind of state of mind.",0

1092,"his nickname is portuguese, and it means something like viih_iam. Or sou could be a  short of the surname Souza, which is very common in Brazil.

viih could be a nickname for names that starts with vi (like vinicius, Victor, vitoria and etc). 

something that could explain how he moves fast is that he could've been using automated piece movement. It is trivial to make one for chess.",0
1093,"I have a theory that has to be wrong, because if true, they'd ask for consent, so no mmr changes would happen.
Theory is that this is the testing of the latest version of AlphaZero, with set openings, and let it go wild after that. I've seen engine vs engine games, and wild is pretty much the expected. Destroying your opponent board just because you can? Yep. But, last i've checked, engines never resigned. And near the end of the video, GC said they did.
This is just so weird thought. Or, could just be a cheater that knows enough to do something, but never play at this level.",0

1132,"The egos of top grandmasters are so fragile, it's fascinating to watch them implode when defeated by novel strategies, resorting to accusations of cheating. Like, after how many losses do they dismiss the results as impossible if their opponent isn't cheating? Usually they start thinking this way long before the results prove they are being cheated against. They just feel like ""How is this possible? I'm too good to be losing this way"". The hubris and paranoia of this mindset does not earn my respect. As an intermediate-level player and fan of the game, it's hard to sympathize with these top GMs as ""victims"" of cheating - Even though in principle I am against cheating, I find myself feeling more schadenfreude to watch them lose.",0
1133,whatever happened to pin of shame? has this guy became so shameless it's not worth it anymore?,0
1134,"I personally don't think this was a cheater I think this was a nearly SuperGM who is not recognised that much cos he might doesn't play classical much...
And the stats are normal also the should be one the best cuz 
1. Its a GM he will play many Best moves
2. He knows that opening well any probably anylysed more than anyone else
3. He's endgame skills are good( That doesn't mean he's Magnus , Its not 2013-2019) 
People are learning ,, and I don't think just playing exceptional is Quite enough Evidence....

Sorry Levy I really like you but you are being stupid here. ""Masking it"" is just playing on their own, making mistakes as any human including grandmasters under time pressure would.

I know in some online multiplayer games it's lumped in with other cheating techniques (like software cheats, game exploits, etc) so you never know if it was cheated gameplay or account-related.... while others actually separate things like boosting, smurfing, etc in their ban reasons so players understand what that account got the ban-hammer for.

In a game like chess that requires high strategic skill rather than mechanical skills, I'd imagine the latter is better to delineate between Stockfish cheaters & alt accounts with legit gameplay.",0
1391,"Was Daniel the one who reported this Viih_Sou account? And were any of these games referenced, publicly streamed, etc. by him? My worry is that this may turn out to be an alt account or associate of Naroditsky used to artificially raise ELO, seeing that the lifetime ratio of wins to losses between the two accounts is very much skewed toward Daniel (I believe Levy stated approximately 400 wins to 150 some losses in favor of DN)? I would hate to learn that is the truth, but that's the explanation I would be trying to eliminate first if I were investigating it. If the Viih_Sou account is behind a VPN, DN may have had little reason to fear being linked to this, so if at some point he got skiddish and/or decided that enough had been gained in the long-run to risk continuing, exposing the alt account personally would be a decent detractor against others suspecting him, especially so if the win streak prior to ban was in favor of his opponent's account.

1404,The reason for giving up the rook is that the Queen rook doesn’t come into the game till later whereas the white bishop is an attacking piece earlier on. So it’s a gamble to eliminate an active piece for a passive piece in the hope that you win the game in the middle game.,6

1430,"Levy seems astonished at the stylistic approach of the cheater, but it's quite trivial to write code that makes an engine do anything you wish, so for example you could assign a premium to ""checkmating"" or trapping the enemy Queen, or try to always get behind and then catch up later (Fritz even had this programmed as 'sparring mode').

1552,"Hmm, who knows? What this smells like to me is a decent player who's testing their own engine, likely a fork of a publicly available one. You can play at any speed you like if the engine is coded to make the moves directly. Better yet the speed of play and the depth the engine plays can then be set dynamically in response to how 'hard' the position is. Why the same 'odd' opening every time? I suspect partly for the LOLs, partly to test the dynamic engine depth, but mostly because an unusual opening will make it harder to spot which engine is being used.

Why?
If my wild guess is correct, this isn't 'cheating' it's a 'programming exercise'.",7

1593,"I think I know what was going on there, Levy.
     Due to Magnus and one or two other notables using such moves, a certain strong player decided to use it and mix having an engine play out the game, AND occasionally THEY play out the game. The point was to see if such a maneuver could win at the highest levels. Whoever was doing it is probably compiling a list of gm responses, vs engine responses, so they can understand both winning and losing ideas in the opening and subsequent moves. With the aim of using it in their own games, but whether against strong opponents or weaker opponents, to be decided by the analysis afterwards.
     Possible suspects would include certain top grandmasters, but could include a lower ranked grandmaster that remains more anonymous. AND could include a 'team' effort; a strong lower ranked player doing it for another stronger player for analysis.
     Regardless, the games are a matter of record, so anyone exploring the analysis to see if such moves could be used in say, titled Tuesday, well now there is deniability, they could simply claim to have looked at it and decided it would be fun.
     Very sneaky. 😄",23

1653,"Hello. So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is. I am not trying to force my belief down people's throats. It's your choice whether you want to accept it. Please read the whole text.

So, a question: Do you think you are a good person? If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, watched adult material? All of those are sins and anyone who sinned is not good(on God's standard). You, I and most( most because babies don't sin, and maybe specifically mentally Ill people) purely human beings have violated God's moral law. Since God is just, He can't let sin go just like that.

So is there any hope? Yes, there is. Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned. 

The reason why blood must be spilled for forgiveness of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the sacrifice of animals were enough to temporarily cover some sins. (it did not allow forgiveness of sins, unlike Jesus's, it only temporarily covered them). Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. Jesus was buried and rose again. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus's spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our Salvation. And then your sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved.    See:  Romans 3:1 , Romans 3:23 , Romans 5:12 , Romans 6:23 , Romans 5:8-9, Romans 10:9-10 , Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV, John 3:16 KJV, Leviticus 17:11 ,  Ephesians 1:7 , Colossians 1:20, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 .",0

I mean, since you always mention thatyour opponent's rating makes you think too much, that sounds reasonable to me. I did it and now I play more freely and I am a lot more concentrated since I do look for the best move in every game now, no matter if the opponent is rated 2500 or 1500.

2893,perhaps there is an option to not show the enemies name so that you arent scared of facing GMs?,0
2894,"i feel like you have to have a little bit of delusional confidence to become a GM especially if youre playing blitz. having that level of confidence will allow you to play so much faster even if you arent always making the best move. as you stated, both your oppenents in this video didnt play perfectly (especially in the second match) but they were confident with their moves which allowed them to play faster and they ended up winning on time. but its blitz anyway so i dont think you should take these losses too hard",0

Maybe it was a naming convention thing? ""Road to GM"" makes it pretty clear what the video is about. Were the candidates hidden away under things like ""Amazing game!"" or ""He won!""? I never watch videos named like that.

When I play against higher elos than me, I also tend to freeze somewhere in the game, even if I'm winning, and than just lose the game, and what is helping me is to prepare my self to run in two modes ingame: if I feel confortable in my position, I just run in (crush the enemy mode) and if some position occur that I no longer feel like winning (or with advantage), to avoid freezing and having a storm of bad feelings/plans, I enter e""prove me you can checkmate me"" mode, where I just make moves that are more defensive and I'm sure they are not bad, even though they are not the best. I never write comments in any videos I watch, but I related to your strugle and also I like you and I want you to become GM. Thank you for years of good content.

does blitz even help levy?
The GM TITLE that we are talking about is for classical games
there are lots of players that are great at blitz but not at classical and vice versa.
maybe blitz helps to have a good understanding of positions but if levys problem is nerves and time management it's not good for him to stick with just blitz.
anyway it's my opinion!

Daniel would be my personal coach of choice but maybe you could contact gukeshes team unless he himself is just a talent he must have the best team in the world for how to create the next world champ.

3066,"I'm no good chess player by any means, but if anyone 600 points higher rated than me gave me advice via a video recap... I would NOT push back on any of his suggestions.",0

3069,Bro why are you so hard on yourself lol chill. It’s easy to analyze anything afterwards with hours to think about it,0
3070,"Keep working at it, Levy.  Enjoy the journey.",1
3071,so stoked for dis bro,0
3072,Go gotham!,0

3074,"Levy voice: so now I guess i should play e4…
Levy computer voice: SACRIFICE THE KNIGHT THEN DA RUK THEN DA KUINNNNNNNN",0
3075,my only question is how do blitz games contribute to GM,0
3076,lets go gotham,0
3077,"I believe in you gotham, please wish me luck in my tournament tomorrow. :)",1
3078,"just cover the name of your opponents on your screen with ducktape or something, so you can't know if your are playing against Hikaru, Magnus or me. these way you can play more loose!!",0
3079,Let’s go Levy!,0
3080,I'm just going to say one thing: Gotham starts with G and ends with M 😎,0
3081,Levy just keep at it as it will come to you don't try to force it.,0
3082,You got this. I believe that you can get GM.,0
3083,"Good luck, you can do it...believe more in yourself. 👍🍻",0
3084,I think an interesting video would be to tape over the part of your screen that shows your opponents name and elo and try to play them. Maybe get someone to curate some opponents of different skill levels. That way you can see how you would play against better or worse payers when you don’t have the pressure of knowing you are playing a GM.,0
3085,"If you had a Patreon, I'd support 👌",0
3086,just play faster bro,0
3087,Loving the honesty and hard work!,0
3088,"Sir, I am one of the biggest supporter there. I am willing to learn taimanov variation of the sicilian but Can't be able to find good course. It would be a great honor if you make a video on it..",0
3089,"Your entertaining. You need to either make a bunch of videos all at once and then focus on GM seperatly, or it's going to take a long time to get to GM and make videos at the same time.",0
3090,Woo hoo..  LEVY!!!! ❤❤❤,0
3091,you would look very badass bald with a long beard,1
3092,Keep goin brotha!,0
3093,Or... maybe... you just aren't as good as those competitors...?,0
3094,"Levy, it will be easier for you to reach GM now than if you decided to try in your 50s, so no complaining about being 30.",0
3095,"Levy you're like one of he smartest players out there in terms of genuine understanding.. 
But if there's one thing I've learned from Guess The Elo then it would be that sometimes, you just gotta go OOGABOOGA mode and maybe you should try that as well? 
Anyway keep it up champ you'll get there eventually 👑",0
3096,"Would it be better to not know who your opponent is for the nerves, or is knowing their styles a big enough advantage?",0
3097,"I'm sure you know, but positive thinking really does work.  You should definitely work on being positive as much as possible.  I'm pulling for you. Best wishes and good luck.",0
3098,"If you get nervous when seeing higher-rated players, it could help if you hide their names when playing and don't know who you're playing against

Although you might lose intel if you played against them before and know what they're good and bad at",0
3099,something is changed. I think 🤞🤞,0
3100,"Amazing to see you take on this journey once more. Even though we’re in completely different leagues, I feel I can relate a lot to your feelings of nervousness when playing higher level opponents and trying to improve at chess nearing 30 (I’m turning 30 in September, currently around 1450 and want to try and get to 2000 before 30). I’ve bought some of your courses recently and will be practicing my openings and middle games as well as my time management as that gets worse when I try to consider the best move for too long.

One thing that you’ve said in one of your videos that makes me laugh but also helps is “When you’re trying to get to a certain rating in chess, you have to kinda disrespect that rating”. Which I’ve taken in as “Be more secure in your abilities, try your best, and you’ll get there”; and I definitely believe you’ll make it to GM. Excited to see what you’ll show us over the coming months/years!",3
3101,Go for it Levy. You got this!,0
3102,"Dude, so much good luck! Been watching your videos constantly for a few months, picked up my own chess. As a noob though. I hope you make it man, really do..!",0
3103,"Been following for a while, bought your course some time ago. I even went to chess spots when visiting New York hoping to get lucky to see a video being made. keep it up!!!",0
3104,I have no business talking about this.. but don't you feel like blitz won't help you much and you need games where you actually can think freely?,0
3105,go levy go,0
3106,"You should participate in tournament where older GMs compete- I ve heard of a 74 yo GM competing somewhere in Croatia in 2023 at a tournament and the guy who beat him is not even an IM... There are 1.8k GMs in the world, if you can find smaller live tournaments where these guys participate maybe you can get to 27 games and keep an ELO of 2500 at the end of each tournament and thus becoming a GM. Playing vs Hikaru won't help imho, the bar is just too high",0
3107,"what we want is just more of this, you trying your best for something you really want",0
3108,Just do not look at your opponent,0
3109,MY GRANDMASTER. GM LEVY ON THE WAY <3,0
3110,"""Getting better at chess at 30 is a tall task"" Oh now you tell me. I started learning at 33.",0
3111,we love you levy,0
3112,"If you showed us one thing over the years is that you know what is important to learn.

If you think it might be valuable to train with a GM and show us the interaction, it is absolutely valuable to us!",0
3113,"As a professional 600, I know you can become a gm. After all you made me a 700",0
3114,No more 3 minute blitz! It’s not helping. You should play like 4 rated classical over the board games per week at least.,0
3115,"Puzzles, openings... what about end games?",0
3116,you lost a bit but your losing against demons. youre giving them a run for their money keep it up,0
3117,"Comon levy you can do it, get that gm title.",0
3118,🙏you got this mate,0
3119,Good luck!,0
3120,Lets gooooo!,0
3121,"Levy, pressure isn't real. Your fans don't care whether you win or lose, they care about watching you do your thing. Winning, losing, or drawing, watching you play competitively is incredibly entertaining, because most of us can't compete at your level. You fabricate pressure in your own head, out of what you believe to be other people's expectations, your adversaries' ability and whatnot. Brains are bitches sometimes, ahah. Just play your game, you're a smart guy and a skillful International Chess master, let it rip!!",0
3122,Gotham's lessons with grandmasters would be great content.,0
3123,probably better off playing in like dark mode or whatever and not looking at the ratings of opponents. i get nervous playing every single game for some reason. im only like 1200. haha.,0
3124,"Don't listen to the haters!  How about this, hide your opponent and their rating, so you always play your best.  I foresee a piece of dark tape on your monitor.",0
3125,"We believe in you. You got this.

And remember, if you feel bad in a over the board game, you can kick your opponent under the table.",0
3126,Hi Levy - I’m 65 and have been playing since aged 5 and stagnated somewhat. Your streams and book have brought chess back to life for me - thank you so much.,86
3127,"How about seeing a sports psychologist and reporting back? I’d love to hear about the advice they provide for anxiety, preparing and stress management.",0
3128,"Let’s go, Levy
You’ll make it",0
3129,"Keep it up, king!",0
3130,"You can do it!
(you probably cannot)
But I will keep saying you can regardles!",0
3131,"Good luck levy, keep going",0
3132,We want vlogsss❤❤,0
3133,"Don't surrender, keep going 💪🏼",0
3134,"yes upload videos about your training , routine!!!!",0
3135,"I think once Levy takes a deep breath and realizes he doesn't need to prove himself to anyone, that he already has a strong fan base and the respect of his peers,  and that pressure releases, he's going to go Rocky 2 on some GM's and claim the title.",0
3136,Go levy,0
3137,Levi never fails to milk my dog ❤🎉,0
3138,Istg levy has what it takes to be a GM he just have self doubt on g,0
3139,I'd friggin love to see some 10 minute rapid but find a way of not knowing what your opponents rating is. Would be great content would be interesting to see how results would compare against rando GMs when you don't know the elo.,1
3140,try to play with hidden names and rating of opponents. u could perform much better. u can check name after game.,0
3141,We're all excited. Good luck!,0
3142,What about bishop d7 instead of knight g4 at 11:40?,0
3143,Does it make any sense to play blitz as prep for classical?,0
3144,Can't wait to follow your journey 😁👍🏼,0
3145,He beat (to) Hikaru,0
3146,"Hikaru made the comment around instinct and that currently, you are too slow. Having watched a lot of your games, you lose a lot of time checking chat and talking. But, nerves are the worst. I genuinely feel that a couple of small strips of masking tape across the name and rating of your opponent on your monitor will give you an extra 30 seconds a game. Play the pieces not the player. It will definitely translate into more time to make better decisions that leads to better rating, which leads to higher confidence which leads to trust in your instincts, which leads to GM norms. You are genuinely not far away 🥊",0
3147,"26:03 
Levy is now beating old people 😂",0
3148,I'm excited about seeing you go down this road. I think you have the skills for sure!,0
3149,Let's go!!,0
3150,Hi,0
3151,"you still got plenty of time, Levy. Yuri Averbakh got his gm title at 40",0
3152,"Levy, you are already a GM in our hearts. Remember that when u play guys like Magnus 😂❤",0
3153,You really need a patreon?,0
3154,"I hope you make the gm title, with all this announcements and making it open to everybody, you can fall very deep if you fail.",0
3155,"Yo levy some good shit right here, kudos and glhf on the glorious GM title, ma man.",0
3156,I believe that Levy will make it to gm soon!!!!!!!,0
3157,"Levy, pls say something about chessnukes post on hilaru’s gambling stream, it’s a verry serious matter",0
3158,Good luck on your journey!,0
3159,,0
3160,Best of luck,1
3161,There's only one thing stopping you from becoming a GM...you!!!    Just friggin do it.  It's well within your means.,0
3162,Good luck Levy. You can become GM. I will actually be really happy for you if you do,0
3163,"Mate if you worry about making mistakes you might do better in the game today, but if you force your self to play fast and make mistakes and lose of few games today you will be a GM tomorrow, success is built upon a mountain of failure, theres no other way, build your mountain bro, dont play with doubt in your mind, be humble, you win or you learn, the only way to lose is to not play",0
3164,"This may or may not help you, but I've noticed when I started studying chess seriously, my slower ratings went way up and my blitz rating went way down. Getting sucked into System 2 thinking is a good thing in classical chess.",0
3165,To 7k comments let's go,0
3166,Show us a timelaps of Levy learning chess.,0
3167,"I specifically waited for the title to change back to ""Road to GM Ep 2"" to encourage descriptive titles ever so slightly",0
3168,did you consider covering up opponents' names and only viewing them after the game?,0
3169,levy stop being scared just play,0
3170,LETS GO YOU GOT THIS,0
3171,"good luck, but not sure why you're using blitz performance as gauge for classical gm. In any case, hopefully you get the title soon.",0

3173,Please make vedio of new chessbot I'm curious what's there ratings according to you 😅,1

Actually Hikaru pre moved this whole game. Nostradamu Nakamura",0
3175,"Naroditsky does some very interesting GM puzzle solving colabs which are super instructive and help to not give away any openning knowledge, haven't seen you guys in the same screen in a while but definetely top 3 chess content creators imo",0
3176,"Sounds like most of your current issues stem from mental robustness rather than skill. I don’t know what I’m talking about but I feel like experience will fix that, the more you play against stronger opponents the less you’ll be nervous. Especially once you’ve got some more great wins under your belt. Good luck! Keep going! Enjoying watching your renewed enthusiasm for reaching that elusive GM title! Much love",0
3177,Olha o krikor ai kkk,0
3178,This is too depressing to watch,0
3179,rather than thinking yourself into confidence you have to genuinely play a lot more against extremely high level opponents till either you give up or your insecurity does.,0
3180,We love you Levy!!!! YOU CAN DO IT!!!!,0
3181,What iffff you cover the name of your oponent is that legal?,0

3193,thank you for this series,0

3199,Yeah Levy this GM series is fcking insane and is fun to watch so pleas more,0

3231,"3 Minute Chess has nothing to do with your Road to GM.
Hikaru stated that he plays bad moves in the opening against you just for fun.
He wouldn't do that garbage in classical chess against you.",0
3232,Great idea to show training with GMs.,0
3233,Road to gm part 2 : still losing to gms,0

3235,Little bro still starting with 1.e4 💀 i thought this was supposed to be road to gm,0
3236,"Hey Levy, I think you should start playing rapid more than blitz because as far as I know tournaments  mostly have rapid and classical time control than blitz. So, to improve, you need to think more and play slowly.",0
3237,we're rooting for you!,0
3238,I fucking hope that one day I'll get to watch a video of your talking about achieving GM,0
3239,@gothamchess take a look at EMDR therapy for dealing with the nerves and panic,0

3250,LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO! Get it Levy.,0
3251,considering we always see him playing 3 minutes blitz I don't believe he can achieve the GM title anytime soon.,0

3276,"Hi Levy, I believe is the 1st time I write a comment.
I'm my personal experience I find more comforting while playing only not checking my opponent's rating.
Maybe you could try to cover the part of the screen where your opponent's name and rating should be , then maybe you could play naturally .
Anyway good luck in your way to GM.",0

3283,I've followed you for years and I will continue to do so. Do your best and don't stress about the rest.,0
3284,Hikaru is cringe,0
3285,"All the best in your quest.  While you mentioned time management as an issue, the norms come from classical games, where hopefully that will be less of an issue.  As Hikaru said, you have the ability, so steady the nerves and you will get there.  If it were as easy to do as to say, it wouldn't be a challenge, but I and many others are in your corner rooting for you.  Borrow our belief.",0

3312,"To test that maybe the 'rating' throws you off, why not setup a game where you are blindfolded and you don't know who you are playing. So it might be a higher-ranked GM or it might be a 1000 rate guy. See how you play like that without knowing who you are facing.",0

I was stuck on a plateau around 900, I was getting ELO anxiety in rated games. You inspired me to break 1000 finally. I know you'll make GM!!

Thank you!!",0
3316,"I have been thinking, if the opponent you play against is the reason you would panic or get overwhelmed, maybe it might be worth trying to play without knowing who your opponent is? Obviously, this may not be a plan for long term, since for physical tournaments you have to face your opponent, but in titled tuesdays, I don't see why it would not be possible. My thought process is that if you do not know who you are playing against, you have to be prepared for anything and give it your best. It might no longer inflict that much anxiety.",0

3344,"Yeah the nerves really get in the way of performance. I used to REALLY underperform in exams because of it during junior high and high school. I eventually got over it during college starting from a finals period when I didn't have time to do a final hard review of the material for certain classes in my major. I just said ""f* it, that subfield is not what I'm going to pursue in the future and my overall GPA isn't affected that significantly"", then I went in the exam and somehow aced it. Of course I listened to each lecture seriously and studied regularly, so this is not to say just have unbased confidence. 
This experience really made me realize ""not caring"" is the key to these types of anxiety (at least for me) and that ""f* it I can make things work fine with the stuff I know and the things I prepared beforehand"" just might be a more practical interpretation of the old saying to ""believe in yourself"".  I'm still not like oblivious to the nerves yet or as Hikaru would put it: I still care too much. This might not be the case for everyone, but hope it helps someone.",0

Keep pushing, I can’t wait till I see the video titles “IM OFFICIALLY A GM”",20

3412,Is it possible that you just cover up your opponents name and rating before going into a match so you don't know who you're playing and get nervous?

I got tired of the changes in software mechanics/physics/handling so i wanted a game where the rules stay put. I was fluent with 2 fighting-game characters as if they were an extra pair of arms

Always remember that you got the one thing that you'll always need which is *FLUENCY*

It should help you to not focus solely on perfection --which i agree is necessary, but limited in reality-- but rather maintain adaptation

I hope this helps. You are a great content creator, your explanations and reactions are very vivid and human, not slow and dull

Stay awesome👊",0

3537,"We're rooting for ya - nothing like a comeback story. Having been there myself in many ways - it takes a lot to maintain a top score - but to come back from failure takes that special lil gleam in one's eye. You've got what it takes.

3542,Hikaru spends 54 seconds to take some snack not for sack u levy 😂,0
3543,Definitely want to see the lessons from GMs.,0
3544,"It makes zero sense to be intimidated by Hikaru.  He’s rated so far above you there’s no pressure of any kind.  Even if you lose, you’re supposed to lose.  I don’t think you even lose any elo if you lose so it’s basically a free game.  In cases like these, you should go for the throat and be aggressive and try to beat him.  Putting him on his back foot also has the advantage of being the best way to draw.  That’s the mentality you should have.",0
3545,"I swear to god, the cannel is dying and getting boring, dude used to be decent and entertaining but now he is clickbaiting everything and cant stand him more than 2 minutes. goddamn u became boring dude. cant do anything without other pro chess players. Your channel is died dude.",0

3552,you got this bro we all believe in you,0
3553,"Levy, you are literally Max Verstappen's personality put into chess.",0
3554,"Genuine question: why are all the games you show in this series blitz? It seems like a very common theme in all these videos is that you end up in time trouble due to nerves in blitz games against higher rated opponents, but I don't recall you including any of your games in longer time controls. Do you run into the same issue in 15+10 rapid? It seems like part of the struggle is that when you take 30 seconds to collect yourself, it's like 20% of your clock and you end up with literally no time to calculate. In a longer time control, you can afford to invest 30 seconds to take a deep breath.",0
3555,Can someone explain to me why his road to GM seems to be focusing on blitz games? OTB tournaments are usually much longer right? It also seems like longer games would be much better for honing your theory rather than just being under time crunch every game.,0
3556,"Showing some more tools (like you once showed opening tree, and now mentioned chess tempo) - would be interesting.

You mentioned how you play worse due to knowing who your opponent is. So how about playing in zen mode with names turned off? Would that increase your performance in the TT event? Or do you have prepared openings for specific players? 

I recall there once being a anonymous tournament. But I failed to watch it. It would be interesting to maybe include a chess engine even.",0

3570,Def want to see GM training content   PLEASE!!!,2
3571,If you think its psychological even if you dont mean it to be would it help to hide the name+rating of the player? Just like tape over that part of the screen,0

3573,What if you deliberately stop yourself somehow from learning who your opponent is?,0

3579,I guess “Doing Slightly Better than Usual Against Hikaru” is too long for a YouTube title.,0

3591,Training with other GMs is a great idea. So is vlogging some tournaments,0
3592,"Levy, I have a challenge for you. Play an entire titled Tuesday without looking at who your opponent is. Cover your screen in that spot and just play your games and see how you do. 

If the concept seems risky, just remember that it will make good content. Let’s just see what happens.",0

3602,"win lose or draw, have fun

3603,"I think that if levy somehow would be able to cover the name and rating of his opponent he then could be able to get less panic and maybe play better, that would be fan to see!
Sorry if i made mistakes writing this, english is not my first language❤",0
3604,"Again, im not sure why he is showing us blitz games when he is trying to get a GM title in classical. It has some value but, this just seems fluff content.",0
3605,Surely you shouldn't be too concerned with blitz time management on your way to GM? You get GM by playing classical tournaments right?,0
3606,"you couldn't beat hikaru in a straight up game (where and when Hikaru is trying) if you had two life times to do it, and seemingly also not when he's not trying",0

No shit we all hope he still is",0
3608,"As for content, I would really like to enjoy seeing you train with GMs or even just train in general.

3711,"Hello. So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is. I am not trying to force my belief down people's throats. It's your choice whether you want to accept it. Please read the whole text.

So, a question: Do you think you are a good person? If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, watched adult material? All of those are sins and anyone who sinned is not good(on God's standard). You, I and most( most because babies don't sin, and maybe specifically mentally Ill people) purely human beings have violated God's moral law. Since God is just, He can't let sin go just like that.

So is there any hope? Yes, there is. Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned. 

The reason why blood must be spilled for forgiveness of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the sacrifice of animals were enough to temporarily cover some sins. (it did not allow forgiveness of sins, unlike Jesus's, it only temporarily covered them). Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. Jesus was buried and rose again. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus's spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our Salvation. And then your sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved.    See:  Romans 3:1 , Romans 3:23 , Romans 5:12 , Romans 6:23 , Romans 5:8-9, Romans 10:9-10 , Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV, John 3:16 KJV, Leviticus 17:11 ,  Ephesians 1:7 , Colossians 1:20, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 .",0
3712,"Honestly Levy imo is a great chess player. He gets the game better then most. He is quick, witty, funny. But bro lacks some processing power. Thats the difference. Thats why you freeze. You dont freeze because of nerves, you get nerves because you realise you dont know what to do and freezeband that realisation is why you start getting nerves. You need to griiiiiiiiiiind like a mfer. All day, all night. Every fking position possible do a test game and against someone. You can not go on a Europe trip man. You can not pump out vids looking at other games. Just like an MMA fight you need a prep camp. You need to find ways how to be creative. Then maybe you can do it.",0

3795,Lets go for 7000 :D,0
3796,"9:15 , this part of hikaru's mindset is one of my biggest takeaways. Move quickly and synergize your pieces, everytime i see hikaru in a losing situation or wanting to apply time pressure he synergizes his pieces and hunts tactics for different spatial and angular advantages. I also think if you turn off seeing other players and looked to crush everyone you play, you're already GM level. I enjoy this kind of chess. 50s of thinking mean youre losing lmao, great game",28
3797,"It does suck when you don't convert a ""won"" game, but being up almost 3 points in a middle-game against Hikaru is an accomplishment by itself.  Hang in there!",0

3803,I really respect that you show your loses and have insight and humility about mistakes you've made. I'm Very hard on myself when I lose and it helps me to know that someone who I've learned a lot from has similar struggles. Thanks for your content.,0

3809,Köln Pronounciation was actually on point 👌,1
3810,Hikaru in his review was talking like you didn't get a 2.7+ position on him and made him think for nearly a minute in blitz.,15
3811,"For reference, the title as of 5 hours after upload is ""BEATING HIKARU?? (ROAD TO GM)""",0
3812,I would love to see more behind the scene videos!!!,0
3813,"Nc6 was the better move 4 sho, however A is better than C from which it is better to play C rather than A. Not so complicated. Inevitably Bg7 pierces by a Queen and hits the Rook. Tell me, what would the evaluation bar say then!?  Ah, suppose I will go ahead and finish the video now, only 31 seconds left.",0
3814,Do the thug shake 😐,0
3815,"lessons would be cool, a bit more interesting than training games (like the last time) imo",0

3817,Hey Levy a class with a GM would be super interesting to see! Keep going for the GM title 💪🏻,0
3818,"Levy has the mindset and the maturity to become a GM. 
Obviously his technical knowledge is already there, but his self-awareness and objective perspective of his own faults will take him a long way. 
He identifies the mental mistakes he is making, and is on his journey of slowly but surely minimizing them and ultimately getting to the GM level. 
You can do it Levy, good luck bro. We are rooting for you. 
Enjoy the process, and focus on improving. The title will come, no rush buddy. Just enjoy.",0
3819,Ego’s Clash! Haha,0

3821,"Hey Levy, although you probably wont see this, i gotta say you seem to be dealing with the losses a lot better than before. Much more detached to the result and more genuine curiousity about what went wrong. Seems much more healthy and constructive, good luck on the GM road!",0
3822,"Such a weird feelings comes to the fact that i have seen all the games mentioned in the video, this Gotham man has made me addicted to his content, huge props.",0
3823,Nice nice ⚘️⚘️,0

3825,Keep going you will be the GM we all want,0
3826,"Levy, that’d be good to see “a day in the life” just to make what you’re doing seem more “real.” I think it’d go over very, very well.",0
3827,"Why skip past the first two Vs. Hilaru games?  Have they been covered on other videos?  I think it would have provided great context to see all 3 games in a row - You asked at the beginning/end what we would like to see on this series, I think a deep dive on the 3 games vs Hikaru - and perhaps other groups of games you've played against other GM's too? - to show the continuity in your playing style, it's interesting to see how it develops from both players",0
3828,"When playing online, just cover the name and Elo of your opponent. This way, you have no idea who you're playing, what their strength is and you can just... play as you normally would. This seems to be your issue, primarily. Your nerves are your issue but, what are your nerves doing? Your nerves are preventing you from playing as you would. You're no longer being you. You're trying to be what your opponent expects of you or... something. You know what I mean?
So... cover their name, cover their Elo... and just be... you. Levy, you have very good instincts. During the candidates when you were invited to join the commentators, you had some very good insights to offer. You have a good sense about the game. Use that. Just... be you.
I mean, look at Hikaru, look at Magnus. They're just... being themselves. Heck, look at Alireza. He really just is doing whatever the blazes he wants. So, yeah, to help you get there, start covering the names and rankings of people when playing online.",0
3829,"Levy, every loss is a learning experience and not a failure! You only fail when you fail to learn! Keep going and stay mentally tough!",0
3830,"Random thought: Blind Chess players can't follow many YouTube chess videos because people say ""he goes here, I go here""  showing it on the board sometimes when other times you call out the move notation. It would be helpful if instead of ""here, here"" you said the notaiton.",0

3858,"I havent commented in like 10 years, commenting here because i want to boost your analytics!

Im rooting for you, super excited I get to continue to follow your journey!",0
3859,"When Hikaru keeps repeating the opinion that Levy has hindered his progress in chess because he teaches lesser able players, what comes to my mind is, although I like Hikaru, this type of comment is arrogant and dumb.",0
3860,We would like to see how an IM trains and learns. We know how us noobs attempt to improve bu I think I speak for a lot of your viewers when I say we would all be super interested in as much of your training process as you can divulge.,0

3864,Good luck on the journey! I am with you to whatever end.,0
3865,"I notice how you speak differently about your journey through these games. To me, there is some new kind of curiosity and fun about your exploration of so called weaknesses like lagging behind on the clock. In this video, it all bears some lightness, some inner knowledge of the kind ""yeah, of course that's not optimal - but does anyone think I'm going to repeat this behavior forever? Heck no!"". It leaves me behind very calm and content, other than with earlier videos about the GM journey, that had left a grave impression on myself.",0
3866,"Levy never fails to never fail. Jk, you got this. You’re gonna be GM in a couple years",0
3867,Do the Behinde the scene and name it bts😂,0
3868,"Levy, you should try to beat weaker rated players in the fastest possible time even if
you lose a few, that you would previously would have won. 
I think it'd help your speed, against higher rated players.",0
3869,"is it smart decision to play 3+0 and hoping to get GM title, wрich achieved playing classical time control?
Doubtful, but ok.",0
3870,"Wouldn't it be a bit of good content for hikaru, or any other gm who wants to benefit from your platform, to do some teaching style content for your level? and then on your channel you could dumb it down to our level. But maybe that kind of content is a bad idea to be online since it gives people you face an unfair advantage into how you analyse positions.",0
3871,I would prefix all these videos in YouTube with something like `Episode [X] - Road to GM - [Title]` so then it is easier to follow the whole season,0
3872,if you wanna learn more about ego then i would recomend healthygamergg on youtube. maybe you can even have a talk with dr k on high level competition.,0

3874,6:00 nice to see Levy being a bit confident with his attitude here in general,0
3875,What you have to do is put a little piece of tape on your screen so it covers the name of your opponent,0
3876,"Could you make this Road to GM season 2? and make each season a year long, so last year/ last time you did a bunch of tournaments for rating be season 1?

3879,"Levy we are the same age, I started watching your videos in March of 2023 and set the goal to break 1000 rapid. I achieved my goal in June 2023 and then pushed my bullet and blitz ratings past 1000 as well. I’ve since played and beaten several players over 2000 and your instruction has been directly responsible for that progress. It is tough starting late in life but your journey is inspiring! Over coming that mental block and still playing your best even when you are losing seems to be the way. Good luck on your road to GM, you’ve inspired me to make a goal to  break 2000!!!",0

3884,Nice,0
3885,You would be a grandmaster if you didn't know who you were playing.,0
3886,19:47 finally able to admit it,0
3887,"I've seen you play blindfolded. So I know you see the board well in your mind. I know you understand openings pretty well. I've seen you come up with winning ideas in the middle game. Aside from growing your confidence, perhaps you are not taking full advantage of your threats in those positions.
     Enjoy your channel; very informative.",0
3888,This series may not always overcome the clickbait content but it's great to hear that people were on board for the start.,0
3889,Strategy vs. Tactics. Look like Hikaru simply keeps his bishops and Queen pointing towards the  white king an let Levy spend time with puzzles.,0
3890,Hey could you explain me this opening (you are sacrificing a rook in it) this is a4 e5 rook a3 bishop x a3 and this is named the opening ware,0
3891,for the algorythm,0

3893,I am glad you are self aware. Only way to move forward is to recognize your weaknesses. Do not be to hard on yourself you are one step closer than an arrogant persone,0
3894,"Levy, do you play blitz only?",0

3904,"You make good money with your channel, maybe it's time you hire a good sports psychologist, no? I mean, besides the normal psychologist you probably already have (I have one too to help me out with my OCD, nothing wrong with that). Mentally you need to improve.

3905,good video,0

3936,commenting for +1 comment,0
3937,I don’t get how titled Tuesday is related to becoming a grandmaster. How is getting faster at 3+1 helping you reach a GM norm?,0
3938,"One thing I've noticed when you reviewed the Candidates games versus your games:

Whenever you viewed the candidates games and Nepo, Nakamura, Fabi, etc. didn't play the best move, you'd often say ""That's impossible to find"" or ""Easy move to make with the engine but difficult to make in the game"" In your games you look at the engine and go ""I don't know why I didn't play that"" or ""that's what separates me from being GM.""

Don't doubt yourself! You have the strength of a Grandmaster, don't use the engine to get imposter syndrome. You got this Levy!",1577

3943,Taking the bishop there is so natural with little time.,0
3944,I think it’d be monumental for you to get the gm title because that’s the only thing they can say to downplay your influence on chess . Chess has grown in BIG part because of you .,0
3945,let's goo Levy!!!,0

3949,Nice,0
3950,14:22 to 14:32 was just too funny for me,0
3951,"I saw Hikaru murder Anna Cramling. There is just a dramatic difference. That 3300 actually means something. Who knew.
You might try grinding out games against better players and for every game you let the computer mock you and learn deeply from every difference it would have made. Like a delayed Niemann. 
Also getting coached by hikaru might work although I'm not sure he knows why he's good. Also maybe condemn the evil of fellow jews because if you can't, your chess wont matter. At all.",0

3962,Lets go! Cheering for you!,0
3963,"I'd love to see you hide the players name and play without knowing the rating of the opponent. You will become a GM, your biggest challenge is your own mind. I think you'd definitely perform better without knowing the opponents stats, hiding them would take some of the pressure away.

3965,COME TO BRAZIL LEVY 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷,0
3966,"Levy, Have you thought about hiding your opponents name/elo while doing Online tournaments? i think it could help you to not be nervous and to focus on your own gameplay and time management! I know that the strategies that help me as a 1300 probably mean nothing at your level, but I consistently perform better if I don't know my opponents rating. Also Watching you become a GM would be genuinely amazing! I have loved your content since i started watching in December 2022 and I am so grateful for you because without this youtube channel I probably NEVER would have started playing chess in the first place! Now i am better than my Dad! Thanks for all the amazing content. Just know that if i wasn't broke i would definitely subscribe to your twitch/patreon or whatever...",0
3967,"Levy, I think you SHOULD play rated games when you feel your mind is fresh; I've noticed that, you could probably be the type of player that can easily make great moves in the chess board when your mind is relaxed and upbeat. You can see fantastic lines when you're on a roll or you feel inspired; yet when you feel your mind is lazy or kind of stuck, refrain from playing, however, I'm not 100% sure you're that type of player, it's just that you coincidentally posses some traits that complement such a character.
On paper you might be an IM, but the way you analyze chess games, says you're GM level. ANd have more confidence in your experience for crying out loud!!!",0
3968,some content on your training i think could be very interesting and educational,0

3979,"Best of luck! I really hope you make it, no, I know you gonna make it, as long as you stick to it! Just keep trying, you will do it!",0
3980,Have you thought about covering the player name so you wouldnt know who you are playing?,1
3981,"Another thing is that you need to stop making excuses when you lose and  learn from your mistakes  and move forward. Always having an excuse  will always drag you down .

4002,"I think you shouldn’t overanalyze your speed playing here. To get to GM, it’s all about classical. You don’t need to play fast as much. I think maybe one way to think about it is, if you lose on time but played with high accuracy throughout the game, that’s still success. Because that means you’re not mis-analyzing positions while keeping a decent speed, which will be helpful for classical. 

I think it’s a mistake to agonize about your 3+1 blitz performance as a representation of your GM progression. It’s nice practice and you can treat it as reactive puzzles but don’t say “I failed at Titled Tuesday so I have no chance at a GM norm”.",0

4006,i would love a patreon.,0
4007,you MUST follow your dream. don't listen to haters who are saying your a fail because you aren't!! they're only jealous. (i'm italian and im not too good at english so I may have made some mistakes,0
4008,I think longer when my opponent makes a mistake than when they have a good position. The long think isn't always a good sign. 😄,0
4009,Vlogs of OTB games would be cool!,0
4010,"Maybe you can make a video after an event about some of the opening prep you did for that event.
Also, since you mentioned in the last video how the nerves get to you after a bad move, maybe it is worth playing a practice where every 10 or so moves you intentionally make a bad move so you aren't anxious and flustered about the bad move but you learn to focus on recovering  from the bad move.
Good luck.",0
4011,"Hey man I love your content and watch almost every video. I beg you to start implementing a new concept to your life (can help you reach GM title). Start changing the way you think about stress and pression, start saying to yoursel you’re the calmest and most resilient player there is, even if you do not believe it, it will amaze you how it can change your personality and behaviour long term. Again I never comment on any video but I really want to see You succed, I get you’re smart  just by watching your vids, you surely already know what i told you but start implementing it as I also estimate you haven’t. I hope and believe you’re going to make it will be following your journey✌️",1
4012,nice,0
4013,"its so weird  to hear that you are nervous playing against hikaru.. why?

im a gamer (not chess) , and i thrive on facing better opponents. They're expected to crush me so i have nothing to lose,
they are stil flawed humans and it excites me to know they will make a mistake eventually which i can explot and crrush.",0

4017,"Hikaru is one of the best players on the planet. And top 3 best blitz player ever, if not the best. Your emotions getting involved is absolutely understandable. It would be for 99% of the people on earth. Hikaru is a beast. Your a great player too. In time you will get better in controling your emotions playing elite players. Hope you get GM status in the future. You have the chops to get it for sure. Cheers!",0
4018,"How do you practice time controls? It's all well and good to say ""I need to get better at clock management,"" but I'm really curious how to accomplish that, practically. It would be great if there were exercises you could work on in isolation, but it seems hard to design such a thing.",0

4026,dont you hace to win classical not blitz?,0
4027,"Hey Gotham, if something feels hard or you feel like it is a skill issue / you are just not good enough etc. it just means you are learning and improving! You should look at it positively and realize that it is just how learning feels. Tomorrow, it will still be hard, maybe the next day as well. But a few days later, it will start to feel a little less harder, few weeks later even less harder and one day you will notice it no longer feels hard and you learned it, overcame it! That all these feelings were just, me improving. Don't overthink your feelings!! They are just emotional responses to a situation without context. ❤",1
4028,I think Hikaru has a point. You need to learn a wider variety of openings and imo you should force yourself to play in uncomfortable positions until you lose that mental block against GMs,1

4034,"i don't know how useful this is, but during online games and events like titled tuesday, it could be a good idea to block off the part of the screen where you see who you're playing. this makes it so you take the nerves away, although this could impact which opening you play, thus i don't know how useful it could be, but maybe it's an idea.",0
4035,you still gotta eat more rice and beans to beat these kind of opponents,0
4036,these clickbait titles are beginning to annoy me...,0

Can't expect the final form Levy out of the gate -- I am sure this isn't news but I see a shift in the way you digest the loses, keep it up and it will pay dividends!

4066,Why don't you put a piece of duct tape on your screen to cover up the opponents name and rating? İf you win against a high rated player you only see it after the game. (İ just saw other comments suggesting the same thing... İ'd like to see a video of you playing that way),0

4098,Just focus on rapid and classicsl man. The variance in blitz games is going to tell you nothing about your classical and rapid skills unless you analyze 100 games played against an individual,0
4099,🤙,0
4100,Really like the video! Hope to see you hit GM soon! Would love to see more OTB videos like the one you had with Sagar. I could also use a breakdown of the game after cuz I'm too dumb to understand some of your moves.,1

4123,Rare Costa Rica mention🎉,0
4124,"While title Tuesday is great and facing off against GMs is great content for the road to GM, I think there are better videos to be made for this journey. Would enjoy seeing you break down your studying habits. How many days of the week do you practice and for how long each day? How much time is spent on doing puzzles, analyzing openings and analyzing games. I would love to see a video covering these topics! Would also love to see you layout a timeline of goals to hit to help you reach your GM goal! 

(I think bullet and blitz games should be secondary content for this journey, given that you will play less accurate with the time crunch, while showing us the slower methodical training would be more interesting given the context of road to GM.)

Good luck on your journey, hope you’re successful!",60

4129,"You need to realize that you have to do what you 'feel' is right, without fear. Only then it can be measured if your actual skill is GM-worthy. Not taking risk that feels good lives from the assumption that the opponent is better - and would lose even if you were in fact better. 
It seems like this is also your realization and stopping this while learning which of your decisions would actually be worth (because of trying it) could do the trick",0

4135,You should contact Michelle Khare and do a challenge of two like she do. I feel like you lack some ”lunatic confidence”. Maybe gaining confidence in yourself when your uncomfortable is a quicker route to solve your problems than head banging chess games into a wall. Maybe do both,0

4137,"Love the update Levy! Would it be possible for you to record yourself playing a classical game vs. a player whos rated close to you?

If an ill-educated stranger might say. It seems to me that your issue isn't skill or lack of ideas, but rather the perception of 'danger' leads to indecision and freezing instead of motivation to fight - you lack the courage of your convictions. ""This is my game and I'm going to execute it!""
Might I encourage you by suggesting the services of a good sports psychologist? I suspect you are 'lacking' nothing else.",1

4157,"Look Levy, you need to challenge and go beyond the idea: ""Let's not be confrontational."" I'm terrible at Chess, but I know that Chess is a board game simulation of a BATTLE. The whole purpose of the game is to dive INTO conflict. Being a nice guy in a conflict welcomes defeat.

4229,"What is this insane reaction about “clickbaiting”? What is it that you people don’t understand? Content creation is a BUSINESS. It’s how people make a living, how they feed their family. If Levy gave the videos titles like “Candidates 2024 Round One” they would get a fraction of the views and would make less money. Have you ever managed a business? If you made widgets and advertised them as X and made $50 versus advertising them as Y and making $100 WHICH ONE WOULD YOU CHOOSE? If you’re complaining about “clickbait” you are completely clueless, have never run a business, perhaps never even had a job. Give it up.",0
4230,"Good luck with your goal Levy!

You mention getting trained by a GM, but have you considered asking someone you know like Hikaru to play like an hour or two of continuous blitz games - obviously you might lose 15 in a row or whatever, but also it might help take some of the novelty away, and help with the nerves a bit - by the fifth game or whatever you'll just be playing chess rather than 'a super GM' and it might help afterwards as well.

And at worst it might be good content?",3

Everyone is pulling for you and  as you know, the haters are just insecure losers who need to hurt somebody to feel better about themselves.  I agreed with Hikaru when he said the challenge for you will be the psychology, I can see that.  This is easy to say and hard to do, but if you feel your confidence shaking, just remember how loved you are by your fans.  You GO Levy!",67

All you can do if you're drawing something for 30 seconds, really, is draw wireframes. But what it does, is it actually helps drill an understanding of position and proportion into you. Now, I'm not a chess player. But I have a hunch if you force yourself to make a move every, say, 3 seconds, and get really disciplined at that, you may find you will become better at evaluating positions, not to mention just get more comfortable forcing yourself to move quickly and short circuit indecision. I'm sure if you do this your rating will tank for a bit. But maybe if you do this, it will ultimately help your play in the long run, and help train you to stop being indecisive?",0

Why do you want that ""GM"" title besides your name? Because you think you can?
There are 1700 or so GMs and you can become one of them ... fine. But what do you gain from it? Ego?
You are the one and only IM that every chess player in the world knows, because you are doing what you do best. None of the 1700 GMS can do what you do! None! Even Magnus envys you.
You have money in the bank, millions of people that follow, love and appreciate you, a loving wife and even a dog!
I don't understand why you go back this road. If it will get you a lotta clicks, it will show positively - at least financially. But deep down you know what it will do to you. You don't need it, bro. You are more than that",0

That's really hard to do when you particularly get daunted by the player's *name*. You could block the name somehow, and then, when you realize you've beaten a bunch of high level GMs you didn't know you could beat, you'll gain so much confidence. Perhaps it'll help you even get in the habit of not really paying much heed to the names even if they're visible to you.

If your training somehow teaches you to think differently, you don’t want that information out there. I would even go as far as to suggest you stop producing content altogether for the immediate future unless it’s a much-needed distraction during your training.

I genuinely believe that Hikaru would be the highest rated player in the world and be the longest reigning world champion in history if he didn’t create content. The fact that he does all of that and still gets to #3 is insane. No matter how good you are, you have a finite amount of mental faculties to devote to your goals.

4428,"Dear Levy, when I was younger I used to play competitively in some modalities, perhaps not as much as you in chess, but enough to understand how pressure works on me. What you describe when you play stronger players than you is not what I feel in the same situation. When I had in uphill battle I felt tranquil, because I was lost anyway, and used to play better than usual and sometimes got unexpected results. On the other side I felt nervous when I was playing someone I felt I should beat, but I was having a hard time. Due to that, I think you, Levy, deep inside, feel you should beat those GMs, and you desire it so much that when it is happening, you can’t stop thinking about it. In my case, I was distracted by when someone theoretically weaker was doing well, because those thoughts started invading my mind. “This shouldn’t be happening “, etc. Just my 2 cents and feel free to ignore since everyone works differently.",0
4429,"One thing that might help your nerves, Levy, is trying to remember that even the top players have to see the moves. Think back to the Candidates when all these players missed the best moves. Your opponents have to beat you too, and you didn't become an International Master by being bad at chess. Just like they have an aura around them, so do you and if you can tap into that your opponents will have to deal with the same nerves you do.",71

4496,"But this is just blitz, how will it help you in classical?",1
4497,"This is just a randoms 2cents but I think you should listen to Hikaru, when you say that you moved a particular way ""because of pressure"" rather than because coaching makes your thinking simplistic, that is a false dichotomy - it is possible(and likely) your reactions under pressure are simplistic because of coaching, rather than being one or the other. These two things work against you in unison.

also, if you recognize that you have an issue when facing exceptional players, you should stop feeding into it by looking and analyzing your opponents strengths all the time. For example, stop going into their profile to see how many games they have and their ratings, etc - you have a bunch of habbits like that against randoms, of course you're preoccupied all the time with big names. Unless you have a specific player-centered strategy in mind, it should not matter who your opponent is for your next move - you are playing chess not psychology. 

You spend way too much time on metacognitive analysis rather than improving. You're also doing the classic blunder of immediately looking at engine evaluations after games which gives the illusion of understanding/learning, instead of saving these games for later, working through the moves on your own and then confirming or denying with the engine. Yes, even for short blitz games. You're not a child prodigy anymore, you need every advantage you can get and throwing away real blitz games against talented players for the momentary understanding of ""what went wrong"" hurts you more than you realize.",1
