4,"Neutral lettuce and tomato, no
Violent overpowering onion, yes
ahh makes perfect sense",0
5,I'm glad there's no love for the brioche bun - EVERY bar in NZ uses a brioche bun and I just don't get it.,0
6,With the cheese comparison the only issue I saw is that the smoked gouda doesn't melt well at all. I prefer a slice of provolone and a slice of cheddar. That works for me.,0
7,I do pickles length wise on my burger i make at home haha glad im not the only one,0
8,Wheres the purple onion,0

18,sauce recipe?,0
19,the jump cuts every few seconds are so dizzying,0
20,"I've got to disagree on the cheese, the texture of the cheddar and other regular cheeses is a great addition to the burger but only great when you eat it with the entire burger. They complained about the fat coating the mouth when the cheese oil would go into the bread when it's on a bun and would mix with the sauce. Blue cheese is also a another burger topping that in small quantities really improves the burger with so much flavor. Pepper jack is also a good cheese.",0
21,<<<Sees a smashed patty for the first time and thinks WTF are they doing to that patty.,0
22,"Really annoying guy, why is he touching the food all the time?",0
23,"""expert"" I ate burgers at George's restaurant and it is the definition of mid. Even had a burger where it was sopping wet like wtf. Man, any crackpot can have a successful restaurant once they have a social media presence, huh?",0
24,"I am Irish. If I wanted to buy ""American Cheese"", what product should I look for?",0
25,Fantastic.  Nice to see you have a true expert on.,0
26,"Thank you for the video! Learned a lot actually in 20 minutes and there was a great balance between the two speakers! Happy to know the differences in textures, juiciness and sauciness!!",0
27,"What makes me sad when I watch Joshua's shows is that he's not trying to reach for the best quality ingredients, the lettuce and the tomatoes he shows are the saddest vegetables I've ever seen in the face of the Earth, those tomatoes you find them everywhere in the world, all year long, they taste like plastic, they never saw what a real soil is in their life neither a real sunshine. Lettuce is alike. Of course you don't want that tasteless disaster in your burger.",0
28,"Georges burger, No cheese on the top pattie. i flip the top bun after being toasted to toast the top of the bun. That is when I put the second slice of cheese on the top bun to seal the toasted inner keeping the sauce from soaking into and sogging the bun. 80/20 with a razor thin slice of onion under the cheese on the bottom pattie to keep it from sliding around. (Plain unseasoned typically, but will occasionally mix Montreal Steak seasoning into the beef) My sauce is a 50/50 mix of Heinz Ketchup and Gulden's spicy brown mustard! With Doritos' Sweet and Spicy (purple bag). Lemonade or Dr. Pepper!  Perfection.",0
29,Awesome,0
30,"Pickled red onion is so underrated on burgers, no one does it for whatever reason. Its better than pickles imo",0
31,We all knew American cheese would win lol,0
32,"A burger should be eaten with one hand without deconstructing itself. If you want more meat, eat two burgers. Dont put two patties in it.",0
33,If it's approved by George Motz it gotta be one of the best😌,1
34,"Hey man. Huge fan of your channel. Your extremely rounded in what you can cook. I was wondering if you could make video on how to make”naengmyeon”. Its a korean noodle dish. I believe the broth is made kimchi, pickled radish brine and beef brine. 

Thanks and hope you see this 😅",0
35,Can you share your sauce recipe,0
36,As soon as he said sauce was unnecesary on a burger i knew he was a biden voter.,0

38,"Personally, I love that Johnny Knoxville found his passion after Jackass... love the lambchops as well!! ;-)",0
39,value in both these burgers but I'll have George's every time if i can.,0
40,People giving Josh crap in the comments but I thought the video was pretty clear this is his burger and the George is showing his at the end. George is here to give pointers and history.,0
41,"I see George Motz, I like",1
42,"they look related, kinda uncanny haha",0
43,"honestly, i never understood using american cheese in anything at all, personally, i despise it and how sticky it is",0

45,"You’re one of my favourite YouTubers, I’ve been here since 40k subscribers I’m so proud of the evolution ❤. Wanna help me pay my fine so i can still watch you instead of going to jail LMAO?",0

Feels like everytime George was starting to talk it was cut out.",0
47,I feel insane when focusing on how many cuts there are when George talks,0
48,this reminds me of ron swanson from parks and rec at the burger episode,0
49,Yes! I needed this. Two frickin legends together!,0
50,"oh yes, it's good to feel validated xD I go mustard, onion and pickle topped with melted cheese, no bullshit! xD 100% best burger",1
51,Love the professor honesty and Josh being totally humble. Really loved this one.,2
52,There's one problem with this test... burger style and fat % needs cross testing. different % of fat will feel different at different styles of patty...,0

59,finally my expectation met wolverine and josh making burger,0
60,Is that teen wolf in his final form with sideburns?,0

63,"I grind my meat. Chuck, brisket & sirloin. Homemade creole mustard & the thinnest smear of mayonnaise. Smoked salt & freshly ground smoked pepper.",0
64,"I’m shocked that bleu cheese didn’t make the list of cheeses to test. Mayo, blue cheese, bacon and pickled jalapeños = perfect burger 😊",0
65,I would have clicked on this so much faster if George Motz was in the title.,0
66,"why not best of both world, you sous vide or reverse sear the 60%, then wrap the outside with a layer of crust made from 90% meat. like some kind of burger sushi roll with crust.",0
67,No way those two aren’t related.😂,0
68,"2 80/20 smash patties, American cheese, potato bun, mustard, onion, bread and butter pickle chips instead of dill.",0
69,Im hungry now,0
70,"When I clicked on this I was thinking, how could josh beat Motz? and then he walked into frame. That's a like",0
71,Finally someone checked Josh on drowning his burgers in sauce,0
72,"Okay, now I'm craving burgers the day I decided to go on a cut. I guess we're bulking now.",0
73,"90% he said add butter and it would taste like steak. That’s my go to, 93/7 but rub with clarified butter",0
74,"Stay flexy, my friends",0
75,"Potato bun, thick grilled patty, American cheese, mayo, sliced pickles, sliced onions not cooked, and sliced tomato. That to me is the classic grilling outside watching a football game with family and neighbors cheeseburger. if you really want to make that patty special though what I do is mix the beef with partially sauteed onions&mushrooms (both diced), southern flavor cajun seasoning &charbroil seasoning, and if necessary for the sake of firmness you can mix some egg and breadcrumbs into it. Totally optional way to make the patties and you might not like it but I recommend trying it",0
76,"I like the video, but since taste is subjective, I love brioche for my burgers.",0
77,"American is a cheese product typically based on cheddar. FYI, legally it can't be advertised as cheese. But it sure melts well.",0
78,"*Reads the title of the video*

Me: I very highly doubt it.",0
79,Introducing a guest and then not letting them talk in the video for a full minute is so sad...,0
80,Smash burgers just need to stop... And everyone has there own idea of the perfect burger... Just eat what you like...,0
81,"Trick question, there is no perfect burger but, anyone can have their favorite. Same goes for pizza.",0
82,this is the most elaborate ad ive ever seen for george motz,0
83,"You should make the Emmy burger but better, I call that a challenge.",0
84,"If you do leaner beef in a burger you can't smash it. It has to be thick patty and cook it medium rare at most. The French style of brasserie burger tend to lean that way (to the point it's basically impossible to find fatty ground beef here) but you really have to build your burger for it, with the juiciness coming from the rareness rather than the fat.",1
85,"perfect ingredients dont necessarily make a perfect something when combined, josh",0
86,"George basically just took a good old fashioned cheeseburger, and maximized the necessary flavor profiles, all while keeping things as simplistic as possible. I also agree that while a great sauce is good, it's not needed if you just simply maximize the major components of a burger. It's exactly how I prefer mine tbh",0
87,They looked kinda similar to me...,0
88,"Man this channel has gone downhill I started watching Josh as a dishwasher to make recipes on my day off, worked my up to a sous chef and came back to check him out and was disappointed at the change in videos and subjects the quality and quests are amazing but I miss the ol chef showing us awesome ways to cook things we might not feel comfortable trying at home hopefully it comes back to tips and recipes and goes away from fast food reviews and talking over amazing guests lol not trying to be negative just trying to put a point out there",0
89,"Sorry, but my perfect burger has tomato, lettuce, beetroot (pickled) and pineapple; bacon (not too crispy) and an egg (over easy).
American cheese a no-no.",0
90,There’s no such thing as in between medium and medium rare. This guys is so pretentious lol,0
91,"Actually gotta say I am not too much a fan of this video man. You...really didn't show George the appropriate respect at all and just kinda walked over him. This wasn't a colab, this was Josh with someone in the backdrop...like Im a little disappointed you, of all people, would act like this.",0
92,Like that❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤,0
93,And the finer you dice the onion the better.,0
94,Why even bring a guest on at this point 😂 Josh wasn’t letting my guy say more than 3 words,0
95,🗑🗑🗑🗑,0
96,Very Ron Swanson vs. Chris Traeger battle going on at the end.,0
97,"Remember when this channel was good?  Ahh, those were the days.",0
98,My Mom used snowflake rolls from a small bakery around the corner for homeade burgers way back when. I think the sprinkling of flour on the buns before baking transforms them. IMO the best burger buns of all.,0
99,"Frankly anyone who thinks ""American Cheese"" is good on anything, let alone 'the best choice' on a burger - is a clown. I'm so appalled with you Josh, so many years following you and you've fallen so quickly - like Icarus to the sun, except your wings are made of crappy American Cheese.",0
100,So glad you didn't use tomato...it has no place on a burger in my world.,0
101,"Josh at this point what was the point to bring George and don't listen to him, just make video solo. You didn't let George talk enough, i feel bad for George",0
102,"Gotta love how the best burger cheese isn’t actually cheese at all. I’m fine with this though, I’m not a cheese guy. 

Also when it comes to pickles, love the flavor but I hate how they always come out no matter how hard I bite, think length ways might be the way.",0
103,George is Wolverine?,0

105,all eyes on rafah,0
106,Did Dexter Morgan beat death again?,0

108,"Automatic dislike after seeing them rule ketchup out. A hamburger is not a great hamburger without ketchup. There can be good hamburgers without ketchup, but you need ketchup to make it great.",0
109,George's is 100% the perfect burger!,0
110,Josh your full of 💩. Let the man talk.,0
111,You are a very hairy and good boy,0
112,You railroaded this whole thing instead of letting the burger dude with charisma talk.,0
113,mate what happened to the beetroot - love from Australia,0
114,"Dear Video Editor:  STOP IT with all the jump cuts!!!  It's so distracting and unnecessary.  Were you trying to distract everyone's attention from the amazing guest, so he wouldn't outshine Josh (he totally did anyway)?  Didn't even put George's name in the title.",0
115,Ano kayo lang? penge din kami!!!,0
116,Joshes ego is getting the better of him,0
117,What is the shirt your guest is wearing?!?1  Enquiring minds wanna know.,0
118,"14:42 LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION - no, no link xD",0
119,No tomato on a burger means it's not perfect. Code Talker would be very disappointed,0
120,Don't call Swiss cheese this plastic thing... It's American...,0
121,"I captured your red bell pepper sauce and mixed with a bit of kewpie, put Dijon on the opposite bun and my wife is totally raving!!! Look into it. (Cheese was American and potato bun!)",0
122,"spoilers:
he failed",0
123,"You completely short-circuited all of my main comments/potential complaints by introducing George, LOL!!",0
124,I love that he says he is a steward to history. Such a great statement and it sets up his burger perfect. It’s easy to add all kinds of fried toppings to make an amazing tasting 1600 calorie burger..but make one simple burger. I’m not much a fan of pickles and would swap that for pickled jalapeños but otherwise I’m right on track!,0
125,"Ketchup by its self should not be a condiment! You want a sauce, chilli sauce is the way to go!",0
126,"If you have never tried sliced smoked cheddar cheese on a burger, you are missing out.
Great video!  👍🏼👍🏼",0
127,"This is maybe the first time I've ever seen George Motz be involved in the cooking of a burger without burning his fingers.  It's not the same. 💔

(My perfect burger: 74% lean, salt, pepper, and a small amount of MSG as two thin-smashed patties, thin-sliced onions cooked in burger grease and just a dollop of yellow mustard, Bongard's White American Cheese, toasted potato roll, bun very lightly brushed after toasting with Kewpie Mayo, a couple of sweet & hot pickles.)",0
128,"umm too quick, aderol or cocaine?
as someonw in the industry, yes let the man speak but as an asshole and someone who is fucking exhausted with the ""berger"" (attack me please)

134,What are the added aromatics?!?!? we need to know!,0
135,Next time you get someone to come onto your channel please shut the fuck up and let them talk jesus.,0
136,"Of course you picked smash burger for the patty style. You cooked them all the same way. You can tell you did because it gets more well done the farther you go down.
Grilled is best, and you grill it slower than that and cook it the way through.",0
137,Just came to say Gordon Ramsay burger is MID,0
138,So we’re not going to talk about the bacon elephant in the room?,0
139,love you josh,0
140,Ron Swanson already made the perfect burger. It's made out of meat on a bun with nothing. Add ketchup if you want.,0
141,"My preferred burger: Sesame seed bun, smash or grilled patty, cheddar/havarti/munster cheese, mayo + mustard, lots of onion, some lettuce, and sliced pickles.",0
142,"So basically you pick the greasiest, saltiest and  most ultraprocessed foods you can find and fry them together. Put them on a bun so loaded with preservatives that it'll keep forever. Enjoy!  Americans...",0
143,"For a mustard forward burger sauce I'd recommend Matty Matheson's Holy Trinity Sauce: 2 parts mustard, 1 part ketchup and 1 part mayo. It's burger sauce magic.",0
144,"What the hell is this ""ketchup is for children"" mentality so pervasive in the south. I don't get it and it doesn't exist outside of the south. God forbid you put ketchup on anything in Texas. Every 10 gallon hat in fifty miles will stampede over themselves to call you a child and question your masculinity.",0
145,Anybody noticed how Josh progressively began to focus on what be likes ? 😂😂,0
146,no pepperjack chz should be a crime,0

154,This guy looks like Aaron Franklin's dad.,0
155,"Between the two of you, you've got a great full beard",0
156,Its hilarious that George made a Freddy’s burger,0
157,Yellow American can kick rocks.,0
158,"Pickled red onion is what I need on the burger. Tomatoes are out.. maybe pickles but not per se because pickled onions are the bomb. Yes to the american cheese and the smash burger but I use a toasted pita bun, less bread, crunchy and I think it compliments the burger without overpowering it. Lettuce and yes on your sauce. That is my burger.",0
159,"Have you considered doing more shared critique vids?  It is a fun format that leads to surprises for both parties. I always remember the Chef Netflix series where Favreau and Roy Choi make kimchi (I think) and Roy likes Jon's better, but Jon says, ""Chef, this is YOUR old recipe.""

Either way great vid!",0
160,Avacado bacon burger!!!!!,0
161,you are the perfect human being josh <3,0
162,"""The Smash Patty is the winner""

Nah. No way. Smash Patties are fine in a ""I'm hungry and need a quick burger now"" kinda way but for a PERFECT burger I need something with actual HEFT. Give me a nice THICC patty.",0
163,Hey Josh can you do a juicy Lucy burger recipe,0
164,George is right on the money. I love these videos!,0
165,too much pickles,0
166,the perfect burger was an ... in and out burger?,0
167,these guys are culinary professionals and they chose american cheese. 💀,0
168,Why even have George on if you don’t take any input from him 😭,0
169,"George is the burger master for a reason! Josh’s burger definitely made my mouth water, but George knew what kind of burger I wanted before I asked for it! Good old army phrase is “keep it simple stupid”, which basically means adding extra bells and whistles doesn’t mean it’ll work better. I really enjoyed this episode and I REALLY look forward to seeing what food you make next!",1
170,80% is the perfect because you get a juicy burger but you get that beef flavour,0
171,"The only vegetable that goes in a burger is onion, change my mind",0
172,Idk the authenticity of these videos seem very concerning with how consistently Josh dislikes something that is loved by the masses which of course leads to complaints in the comments which leads to more views on the video. Not having brioche in the top 3 just feels so fake.,0
173,You need jalapenos and bacon on a burger bounded by law,0
174,"I don't like the thick buns. I'm there for the meat and toppings, not the bun. Give me a cheap bun or potato bun, like shake shack. The bun is not the star. Add some garlic butter and toast it, but don't let it be a large part of the burger.",0
175,American cheese has no place in anything.  Just use cheddar.,2
176,I personally like the way muenster. Good on a burger but I feel works even better on hot deli sandwich,0
177,I'd watch him cook anything,0
178,"I like your videos,. but the tiktok-style really ruins it. You should make content for the people living on 1.0 speed.",0
179,20 mins just to make a basic smash burger and call it perfect.,1
180,"No matter how many burger videos YouTube keep recommending to me, I always click",0
181,"Joshua, I usually buy the pickles pre sliced like that, but I recently started chopping them into tiny cubes and then you just scoop them with the knife and lay on top of the sauce 🤌 this way when they start sliding out it's just few small pieces instead of the whole slice of pickle 😘🥒",0
182,Bro make a Cuban sandwich 🥪 🔥,0
183,"Perfect burguer until you put american ""cheese"" on it.",0
184,Josh wanted a perfect flavourful mix of wonders while George just wanted a burger with no complications.,0
185,"So you made a very basic burger lol - bun with sesame seeds, flat patty, american cheese, big mac-ish sauce and a pickle",0
186,"In the UK American cheese legally cannot be called cheese. They're called ""cheese flavoured slices"" because they don't have enough actual cheese in to be called cheese",0
187,Ron Swanson vs Chris Trager,0
188,"Jeez dude, stop talking! George Motz is amazing, let the man speak! Why did you even invite him along? Reign in the Main Character vibes.",0

190,"A smash burger is nowhere near perfect. the fuck are you serving people, let this shitty trend die, give me my moneys worth, not a thin burger.",0
191,"Don't understand why you had a professional burger king on the show but you don't exhibit any studious interest in what he had to say. You merely try to keep up. It's obvious that you've got something to prove, but don't make it so obvious. I only heard statements; not once did you ask him a question, except when you wanted him to rate something of yours. Please practice humility where it's due, rather than arrogance.",0
192,Where’s the bacon?,1
193,I thought Wolverine was busy filming Deadpool 3? How the hell did Josh manage to invite him?,0
194,You fan boyed here and stuffed up the burger,0
195,"I remember making your Smash burger and eating a patty with cheese, it was amazing by it self. You’re right that the fat and cheese make up the sandwich’s own sauce.",0

206,"for me, the perfect burger is Red Robin’s beer cheese fondue burger",0
207,Where's the scrape of vegemite on the buns to add a bit more yeasty umami?,0
208,"Your objection to cheddar sticking to the roof of your mouth and being too loud is a product of trying it on just one smash patty. Smash burgers are best served as a double or triple with cheese ONLY between the patties and not on top. You can get away with a louder, stickier, less salty cheese if you put another layer of beef between you and it.",0
209,"Who would have guess that 2 Americans would pick Amerinca ""Cheese"" as the best option. Cheddar al the way to go, I you digress, You are plain wrong.",0

Youre a hackass josh. Honestly just get off youtube.

221,"Josh, when you get someone like George on your show, shut up dude. Stop talking and let him speak. You just waffled your opinions for 20 minutes and he could barely get a word in. Your ego stomped all over your guest, who has way more experience and knowledge than you do here.",0
222,"you went straight to smash patties - you should have tested patty size too.  last point, dave thomas made square patties so you would taste the beef before the bun - your patties hung over, but a little more beef to hanging out and a greater beef to bun ratio would have been better.....",0
223,Ketchup mustard and pickles anything else and you’re just being a pretentious little prick. 😂,0
224,It stopped being the “Greatest Burger” as soon as you took American cheese over cheddar. 🤦🏻‍♂️ It is literally not even “cheese”. It’s simulated cheese product. Americans lmao.,0

254,"If I was told to just make a burger:
Potato Roll
80% beef patty, smoke grilled
American Cheese
Tomato (Gotta be fresh. if you have your own garden, that can make a tomato leaps and bounds better than most you can get from a supermarket)
Ketchup
Yellow Mustard

But, I am a man of wide tastes. Sometimes i want the good ol' standard, sometimes I want to spruce things up a bit.
So, for a delicious next level version dubbed ""The Uberger"":
Pretzel Bun
1 75% smoke grilled patty
Pepperjack
1 80% smash patty
American cheese
(Have to tweak the sizes of the patties so that they're the same diameter, and the grilled patty isn't too thick, would require experimentation)
Caramelized onions
Jalapeños
Bacon
Tomato
Sauce ( Ketchup, Spicy Brown Mustard, Horseradish, Mayo)

372,Not even close in complexity and def not close to the taste of my fav burger.,0

374,"I tried so long and so many times to get better and better burgers. I tried forming a perfect little patty, seasoning, and smoking it to 135, then searing it. Good. Great even. The inside of the burger ends up BRIGHT pink. It has wonderful smoke flavor. It's a glorious taste. Unfortunately, you know what it ends up reminding me of? A summer sausage on a bun. 
I tried the classic grilled burger , both from preformed patties and hand-made. It's good. Classic, tasty, never would turn one down. It gets that charcoal taste or just the charbroiled flavor from the propane. It's a good contender. 
One time, though... I tried making myself a smash burger. I didn't have a good press or any kind of griddle, so I was using a heavy metal spatula to push down my nice metal spatula. It wasn't great. There just wasn't enough leverage to push that patty nice and flat. I eventually got a real press and I am now in love. To say that smash burgers are the best way to do it is just not enough. Not only are smash burgers the best taste because you don't lose a bunch of fat between grill grates, they are also possibly the most lazy and quick way to fry up a burger.
That said, George has now made my life so much easier. No more need for the quartered up wax paper. I will be trying his method next time I make burgers.
For buns, I actually do prefer the brioche or pretzel buns. They are great at soaking fat without getting soggy. I know the flavor profiles aren't the best in these cases, and the pretzel bun is better for thick burgers, but I do prefer those to sesame buns. For smash burgers though, gotta agree that potato buns are perfect. 
Cheese is situational. I do like american cheese for a simple, no-frills burger, but my favorite one to make is a bacon mushroom swiss burger. That combination of toppings and cheese is just masterful and then there's a chance to use one of the only two kinds of sauces I will put on a burger: A1. The only time steak sauce is acceptable is on this burger.
Finally, 80/20 is foolproof, one of the most common mixes you can find, and if you're not grinding your own beef, it's about the easiest and cheapest to pick up at the grocery store. Some stores go for 73% but that's leaning too far toward the fatty end and you're going to lose something in translation.",0

Personally I like my burgers rather thick, grilled to the max outside and pink inside, with flavor mixed into the meat mixture - some diced onions and garlic and other things. Then you don't want a super fatty mixture - 85% or even 90% will get you better flavor and less dripping.",0

Gonna stick with my smoked thick patty (with seasoning, egg, and Ritz), smoked aged cheddar, and thick cut bacon cooked low and slow.

578,"literally a video on how not to make a burger...lol
avoid basically everything these guys said and you would create a good burger. 
smash burgers seriously the worst of any burger style you can make, completely takes away from the beefy taste a true burger should have, you want that burger tasting like ground steak not over cooked smashed beef, how can you get that perfect medium rare flavor in a smash burger? smash burgers are the burgers that places try to cut corners..lol
buns, you need a bun with a good harder outside, that you can slice and toast, that gives a crunchy split but then softer middle leading to the natural harder outside. These are the buns that will hold up and give you the best of everything
Cheese, if you are talking classic then minimum American and who cares about the color it is the same, then you can scale it up with cheddars based on age. the older the cheddar the less you need to give you the same flavor. 
Anyone who hates on Ketchup is obviously an ignorant clueless individual, sorry but people who are like this just don't have a clue. Ketchup is clearly meant to be on a burger, on a hot dog, etc it was made for these things. When i hear people say ketchup is for kids, you realize you know what you say is the opposite, no ketchup is for some weird kid who has some issues in their lives....like Chicago and their hot dogs...lol please get over yourself 
toppings well that i say is what you prefer and what is going to work well with your burger.
Sometimes it depends on the quality of meat you are using, whether you flat ironed, gas grill, frying pan, or charcoal briquettes cooked the burger and yes this is maybe one of the most important things in flavor. 
Grilled onions or raw? Each has their own place, or none if you prefer
ketchup mustard is literally the gold standard, and if you think it's not then you realize you are in the minority
mayo is good, but certainly goes better when you have some salty component added like green olives and or bacon, otherwise not really needed
lettuce the thinner your burger the more level of shredded you need, the thicker your burger the more whole nice crisp sheets of crunchy quality lettuce you need. Soggy no crips lettuce should almost always be avoided, because it just can't stand up to the residual heat that is going to make that lettuce get more soggy too. A good slaw with some cabbage can also be used, though I would say this is typically much better with a fried chicken or fish sandwich
Butter is the key, maybe outside of Wisconsin most of you don't even have a clue...lol but I'm not talking about just buttering your buns but rather actually slapping a slab of butter on your burger at the end. Even Wisconsin's very own Culver's who claims butter burgers, they don't even get it. A real butter burger here you need to seriously slap on a legitimate slab of some good quality Wisconsin butter, or at least good Midwest butter.",0
579,"It's funny because where I live 90% of the burger joints make those fat 6 oz medium rare burgers on a grill. At home, I make it this way too, but I've been more and more inclined to a double or triple smash with american cheese or even... gorgonzola cheese lol. Also, I usually make a homemade mayo but I eat aside. It's heaven.",0

Pickles can get bent, keep them the hell away from my burger. It's important the tomato isn't too good or it'll dominate, but not too crappy either. Basically I want a whopper with cheese no pickle, with a better patty, better mayo, and whole(ish) leaf lettuce because that helps hold things together and doesn't get in the way.",0

662,"You can either choose the perfect ingredients isolated like in this video, or you can create a flavour profile by adding to the flavours of different elements with the other choices you make. Anyone can pick their favourite ingredients to make a standard (individually) good meal, at least that’s what I believe :D and there’s fun in that! It’s much more interesting to build on a base to fit „challenging“ ingredients and matching them together in a new way to reach new flavour combos, isn’t it?",0

669,As soon as i saw george motz i knew exactly how this video was going to go. Which honestly made it pretty damn boring.,0
670,"Josh In think your burger, the ”perfect” you chose and made yourself, is good but you should try my burger which is the perfect burger.  My perfect burger and again this is my own opinion. But I think if smash is the best paddy style but on one burger you put cheddar and the other you put Gruyère cheese these together create an amazing flavor on their own but then me personally I add some well caramelized onions instead of putting the onions on the burger while you smash it. I add some sugar to the onions while they are caramelizing, this makes them more sweet and in the sauce I only do finely chopped pickles. Then mayo and only like a 25% ketchup to mayo ratio with yellow mustard and a little bit of decision mustard then just salt pepper and garlic powder and that is the Sauce.  In my option I love the sauce so add a lot to the bottom bun and a little to the top. But the assembly arguably one of the most important parts is sesame bun toasted with some of the sauce then pickles sliced lengthwise mainly because I love pickles and they cover the whole burger which makes them a part of every bite then Burger patties with their cheese then the thinly sliced tomato then some more of the the sauce on the top bun and you have your perfect burger.",1
671,"For any melted cheese application for sandwiches or burgers, american cheese is a great tool to use. 

I like combining it with a cheese that has a bit more taste like cheddar. The emuslifier in the american really helps the cheddar not get greasy, and the cheddar really helps the flavor overall.",1
672,"In Summer i tend to halfway smash/Grill the patties. I put an Iron Plate on the half of my (charcoal)grill, smash the patty on  the plate and turn it around on the grill. So you have the smashed crust on the one side plus some grilled flavour.",0
673,Damn they both look amazing 😊,0
674,"Amazing burgers from both, but missing a cheese off the taste test, camembert! Amazing flavour and melt ability, once I had it on a burger I wanted nothing else 😋",0

Hopefully no caramelized onions... overrated. The best I've had in America would be Pete Miller's in Chicago, I will remember that burger forever. Gramercy Tavern in NYC is very good, but serving potato chips with a 35 dollar burger is horseshit. With apologies to Joey Diaz, it's french fries with a burger or go fuck your mother.",0

937,"I went to Hamburger America about two weeks ago. I don’t care what social media thinks but two stars from Pete Wells for a hamburger joint can move me. What I like: (1) the guy running the seating knows what he’s doing and keeps it orderly and moving so even after the two stars Pere Wells NYT review we had only a short, organized  wait for counter seating at lunchtime. (2) George was at the grill making my burger and he seems like a nice guy, and (3) love the design of the place. I got the Fried Onion burger and fries. It’s good. The fries are meh. (Pete Wells also thought them “ordinary”). They need to improve the fries. I’m sure all the instagram sheep will ruin the place until they run off to the next thing the Border Collie leads them to but if you’re down there anyway and want a good burger definitely check it out. Though I would not wait online more than a short time. There are many excellent burgers in Manhattan but I’ll only mention Minetta Tavern because the $31 (or $38) price will deter the social media sheep. 🙂The Minetta Tavern fries are great incidentally.",0

Only way i could have made it better was if i used the two smashed patties, but i have a small pan and i needed to make a bunch, so thick boys it was.",2
1129,"George, always!!!",0
1130,"My perfect burger is a butter toasted sesame bun, spread top and bottom with an acidic lemony homemade mayo, a single 4"" smashed patty with thinly sliced onion OK style (the best buns I can buy are almost 6"" across, so the patty needs to be large diameter), two pieces of crispy cooked bacon with a slice of aged cheddar melted over top. The patty is topped by a disk of iceberg lettuce cut from the head, and hopefully tomatoes are in season, so I can have 1/4""thick sliced tomato.   No pickles ON the burger ever, but a pickle is an excellent side accompaniment. 

Such a burger is 3-4"" tall, but I have a yawning gape of a mouth that would make a basking shark envious, so it's not an issue.

As for beef, for special occasions I like to grind my own using equal parts short rib, ribeye cap, and chuck. I aim for 80/20 and I grind the short rib fairly fine and the rest on the coursest disk on my grinder. Every thing is icy cold so its easy to toss the ground meat as it's almost like gravel until it warms up. once mixed evenly, I form it into 'half patties' and I have always used the scholars method of a quick kiss on one side, then flip, sprinkle onions, smash, then spread with yellow OR whole grain mustard, never dijon and never very much. Just a thin thin gossamer hint of mustard across the patty.  Let her crisp and brown until you are mad with desire and the sick fear that one constant more might burn it, and flip, savour the instant scent of the now sizzling mustard.  place two perfect crisp slices of bacon, a slice of cheese, and put the lid on the pan.  When the cheese is perfect (I have a glass lid so I can judge without taking the lid off and losing the steam), lift the patty with a fish spatula, to lessen the amount of loose grease reaching the bun.  Juice inside the patty is heaven, juice dripping off the patty soaks the bun and renders it mush.

For me the real thing that sets my burger apart is the sliced 'disk' of iceberg. It's crunchy and structure, and has grate texture, but it is immune to flaccidity. The disk is sized by removing the outer layers as though it was the layers of an onion, and the scraps are useful for salad.  I slice the disks 3/4"" thick, and get 6 out of a normal head of lettuce with enough left over to add to salad to go with the burger.  Honestly though, between the fried onions, the tomato slices, and the lettuce, This burger is pretty vegetable heavy.

When I have freshly foraged mushrooms, especially shaggy manes or chanterelle, I will sauté them in butter with white wine and garlic, do up the patty exactly the same, but instead melt provolone over the bacon, layer of mushrooms, another layer of provolone to lock it all down.  With that burger there is nothing on the bun but butter to toast it, and I might quickly soak up the pan dripping before I assemble.

I love burgers.",1

The only way to go though a selection process like this and end up with a Mushroom’n Swiss is to start out intentionally trying to create a Mushroom’n Swiss!

What about Bao buns ? that's a controversial one, but not as controversial as the ramen burger",0
1182,"I have notes:

Obviously a good myard is important to a good burger, but, people underrate the importance of the heme flavor of a bit of pink. Personally, I like a thick burger, with a bit of butter to help with the myard.

You left pork belly products out of the conversation entirely. Why? Doesnt have to be bacon specifically but a bit of cured pork adds so much to a burger. I feel like some crisp pork belly could have given this some extra crunch. 

I think you make a good point about the melting qualities of American cheese, but people forget, you can create an emulsion from many kinds of cheese and Murica it up. Why stop at the basic storebought for the perfect burger? I'd have loved to see something with a sharper flavor.

Sauces, I felt like we got short changed on variety. You gave us ketchup, mustard, mayo and two combinations of those three. Thats it? I'm gonna get real, ketchup isnt even good. There are so many sauces that do sweet and or tangy better than ketchup. Get that shit out of here. For mustard, you chose basic boring yellow? For your ultimate burger? Dream a little. Mayo is great when its home made, or at least a good quality store bought, but I'm getting the vibe we didnt go that route. Please say it wasnt miracle whip? Besides that, there are so many sauces around the world you can pick from. Personally, I like heat from my sauces, and maybe something that steps outside of the American fast food bubble, so I would do a home made mayo with  a Szechuan chili oil and lemon juice, then throw in some chipotle powder, garlic cream, and a splash of dark dark soy sauce for some extra umami punch and some Chinese hot mustard. That gives a nice mix of familiar and unfamiliar notes I think. Sauces are really subjective though.

Pickles. I think again we are short changed by only having pickled cucumber. You can pickle basically anything. The question we should be asking is what fruit or vegetable adds the best flavor and texture to our burger. Cucumbers are decent on texture but kinda a zero on flavor imo. All you taste is salt and vinnegar. Why not check out the vast array of Indian style pickles? Or some Atchara, or kimchi? 

I do agree with the inclusion of grilled onions, can't go wrong there, and seseme is nice choice of not overly sweet bun. That said, I do feel like patty melts are slept on, and a thin slice of griddle toasted bread beat most buns by being crispier and not having to much bread in the bite.

I know the video was already 20 min, but given how much we talk burgers on this channel, I would love to see this broken down into a series with a 20 minute video for each ingredient looking at options from around the globe and getting creative to assemble the database of incredible ingredient contenders, and then a final burger competition between you and some other chefs like George and Guga using the ingredients from the previous videos.",0

1332,Mustard is my kryptonite!can’t do it and I can smell it on a burger first. Absolutely hate it.,0
1333,"Let’s critique Josh methodology lol:

1- You can’t test blend with smash burgers, then test thickness with that size. Maybe thick steaks are better with 65%, who knows.

2-American cheese meltiness is only because the emulsion of cheddar, water and sodium citrate. You can make any cheese just as melty as American cheese using sodium citrate, not just cheddar. You can also chose something else than water as the liquid, like beer. So you should choose cheese based on flavor, then adjust meltiness with more /less water in the sodium citrate emulsion.

3- cook method. You tested grilled, and flat top. You should try more funky methods. My favourite is smoking burgers to 130-ish with a bunch of beef fat in the smoking fire, then sear on a flattop. 

4-Buns (yes, I know it’s the beginning of the video). As with cheese, you can adjust crust stiffness and bread softness by adjusting the fat content of the dough and some other factors like pectin.

5-sauce: Sauce should be added only to add what is missing from the other ingredients. By customizing your cheese  and buns, you should get mostly there, but if you want a maple syrup dauve to take your burger elsewhere go for it. Sauce should not be necessary, but like, a way to take the burger in another direction.",6

1341,"One constant complaint I hear from Joshua and other food channels when testing restaurant or drive-thrus is lack of seasoning. I'd like to point out that these foods are tested and end up being examined by people who like to eat healthier, less salt for one. I agree this is the better way to cook, using little to no salt in prep. That way I can season to my tastes. I'll often ask for no seasoning on anything because it's healthier. It may alter the taste, adding salt at the table and not in the pan but I don't want to be dependant on some chef's idea of salt should be on my food. It's often too much, even in Joshua's case.  The amount of salt in the American diet is killing us.",0
1342,"sorry but onions arent good unless they're cooked they'd ruin the whole burger for me if they're raw. The perfect burger would be the smash with the onions steamed on top just as josh made but then less pickles and sauce. Oh and people aren't ready for this conversation but putting a pineapple and carmelized onions on the burger and dipping it in a bowl of teriyaki sauce (not thick concentrated, more watered down version) is the best burger.",0

1373,"ok i wanna chime in on the TOMATOE. 95% of the time when I go OUT  and get a burger. Tomatoes are low on flavor plus stringy. Then when they are pink  not red it makes it worse. Then if you don't salt the tomatoes it again takes away from the flavor. so if you have HOME grown and picked at the right time. yes its nice to add. 

yes eliminate.",0
1374,"Bun choices, to me the king of rolls for a burger is the onion roll but recently my bakery started to offer Telera rolls and I like those a lot too. However, don't limit yourselves to only using buns. A restaurant I visited, okay I visited a LOT, started to offer Ciabatta and focaccia as options ... and it opened a whole new world for me. The purpose of the bun, and bread in a sandwich, is to keep your fingers cleaner when you're eating. Imagine holding a cheeseburger without a bun! Melted cheese, pickles, tomatoes, eggs, and various other toppings and spreads all over your hands and probably the table and your clothes as well. So, do what I did and start trying other buns and breads when making one of the most perfect meals in the modern world, the hamburger. Eat it plain or load it up, it's all up to you what goes into making your perfect burger.

FWIW, I use Joshua's way to toast a bun but, for me, his examples were too browned. Again this is my opinion, the toasted part becomes too gritty and starts to take on a bad taste.  I'll pull the buns off the heat as soon as I see a thin ring of brown appearing around the edges of  the bun. It's not a big difference in time so keep an eye out. My method gives just the right level of light crispy crunch when you bite into it. 

The best bun, hamburger and hotdog, I experienced 15-20 years ago at a restaurant chain called Fuddruckers. They were made, from scratch, every morning and the bakery was right at the front of the entrance with big windows letting customers see everything that was going on. Those buns were so good I used to say they could serve me just the bun and it would still be a great meal. Sadly they started to use a premade batter and the quality went way down.

FYI, when shopping for a hamburger bun don't pick one up that's delivered to the grocery store in pallets but if your grocery store has a bakery on-site give them a try. Some bakeries at supermarkets are better than others. I'm liking my local Albertson's right now but if there's one in your neighborhood it might be very different for better or worse.",1

I just jumped to the end to see the final rankings and this ish is laughable. F'ing Dairy Queen in your top 5? Yuck. That's just proves that you guys have zero taste in what makes a good fry. Glad I didn't jumped to the end and didn't watch the rest of the video.",0
1851,"Agree with you on almost all. Surprised by Burger King and White Castle. In my area they are some of the best by your standards. Wendy's definitely at the bottom.

KFC fries are OK but not my favorite Freddy fries no thank you I have to say that Jack-in-the-Box is probably my favorite curly fry but 100% but my absolute favorite of all time and it’s limited is at Taco Bell with a nacho cheese dip. My favorite fry is at Del taco hands down the best frys consistently, and I always buy the biggest size. I’ve had fries at every single one of these restaurants except for the one that starts with a J? The one you wanted to put Austin Texas, and I think I’ve only had Bo frys one time.

next time I recommend reaching out to corporate and arranging each fast food restaurant to clean the oil and make the best possible frys you then judge them. I always ask for fresh fries myself and sometimes salt packet.",0

1940,"The problem with the In-N-Out fry trick, which I do definitely use, is that they don't cut their fries all to the same length. So if you order them well done, you get like 70% of the fries (mostly the large ones) done perfectly and the small ones are basically burnt while if you order them regular you only have the small fries and the little nubbins cooked crispy enough and all the large ones are soggy.

Aside from the problem with some fries getting over/undercooked depending on how you order them, the In-N-Out fries just have zero salt on them. You have to add like two additional salt packets to them and hope it sticks because the oil on the exterior has already cooled. I somtimes need to add pepper to them to give them more flavor than just potato.

My personal favorite is Burger King. Their fries are what I consider to be the gold standard of fast food french fry - evenly cooked, a golden color and crisp but not overdone on the outside, fluffy and warm on the inside, and salted *perfectly* ever time with a lot of salt. I have noticed that you get some variations in quality depending on location, but since I typically go to the same location every time, I'm always blown away by how good BK fries are and I don't get the hate for them.",0

2109,"On your preferences on lots of salt - WRONG! You and other chefs are a danger to the health of everyone who follows your advice.

Fries should be served with no salt to let the customer decide how much salt to put on. They are the ones whose taste matter the most, not that of someone behind the counter nor a YT channel host. 

Then there's the health issue and the fact that Americans are dying because of too much salt in their diet. That alone negates your preferences for how much salt fries should be served with.

I cringe on all these chefs that cover their dishes with a 'pinch' of salt that is more like a tablespoon in quantity, and they add salt more than once a lot of the time.  That is why I always order my meals 'no seasoning added please' and add anything I want after it's served.",0

2252,"""can't be regional"". Starts with In N' Out, which is a SUPER regional chain, and until recently, was the example everyone used of a regional chain.... watching more... I've been mainly up & down the east coast of the US, though I've travelled around, and have never seen the first 4 chains. They're all basically California, Texas, or Midwest regional chains.

Looking at the list, most are regional. I know from experience White Castle is regional to NY/NJ and central / Chicago area. There's several I've never even heard of, which is interesting. Growing up, I would get TV commercials for Sonic & Carl's Jr but there wasn't one within like a 8-10 hour drive, and that's in the greater NYC area... I've still never actually seen a Jack in the box or Carl's Jr / Hardees, but I still know they all exist, b/c of commercials and just general brand recognition. Not having heard of like 8 of chains & not having ever seen like half of them is silly. None of them are national chains.

Really only nationwide chains on the list are: McD, BK, Wendy's, KFC, Arby's, Popeyes, DQ, Sonic, Chick Fil' A, & Five Guys. Everything else is regional.",0

2281,KFC fries here in South America are among the worst I’ve ever had. Quality control KFC!!!,0
2282,Does Taco Bell currently not have their nacho fries? I'm guessing that's why it wasn't done.,0
2283,"Hah, slay mabuhay",0
2284,No Wingstop?,1
2285,It is very interesting to see some of the fries at the same restaurants that we have in Canada that look different to what we have and I think they would have changed how they scored on the list.,0
2286,Why didn’t they do Taco Bell? They have the best fries ever.😢😢😢😢😢😢😢,0
2287,Honestly I think Mcdonalds has some of the best Fast food out there as long as it's fresh. their biggest issue is quality control.,0
2288,That sonic experience is so typical now. They became the worst over the last few years.,0

2291,"Bruh this list is so bad lol. Idk if it’s just your area has the worst variants of my favorite fruit places but you ranked my least favorite fries way up. Dairy Queen is ass, KFC has the greasiest most unappealing fries I’ve ever tasted, and the disrespect to Five Guys’ fries is crazy. Culver’s has great fries too, so does Chick Fil-A. Steak and Shake and Freddy’s fries are pretty much identical in taste and texture for me. Cane’s fries are really good too. I just don’t get how this list is so off.",0
2292,i've always raved about KFC fries to my friends. also here in the south we have Krystal instead of Whitecastle and Krystal fries are battered like KFCs and are also really really good. It's too bad you guys couldn't try them,0

2295,"Salt is definitely the key for a great tasting fry.  It has to be applied to the immediately after it hits the fry bin, the high temperature of the fries will fuse the salt to it locking the salt to the fry.  
A restaurant that doesn't have a large number of locations (60+) that imo has the best waffle fries is PDQ and there chicken tenders are of the chart.",1

2309,I'm a truck driver and unfortunately I eat a lot of this shit. This is a bullshit list because everything is so inconsistent. I've had great fries from everywhere and shitty fries from everywhere except 5 Guys. Those jawns are always good and you get 2 lbs of them. I'm weird but when cooked right I'll take McD's and BK fries over everything. White Castle has 100% turned to shit. Loved it when I was younger.,0

2330,"It's interesting watching this being from Australia.  The difference between the same companies is amazing.  Everyone in Australia will agree, KFC chips or ""fries"" (fries to Australians are of the shoe string variety only) are some of the worst hot chips you can buy from a fast food chain.  These days I would have to say Hungry Jacks (Burger King) are the best hot chips in the game but there once was a King of Kings that has sadly disappeared.  Brodies chips for decades used to be the best, hands down, no contest king of hot chips.  They were always crunchy no matter the store you went to, the seasoning they had was amazing and the serving sizes were great.  To this day it is the only fast food chain that I would stop just to buy hot chips. 

Also, what is with the American pricing system??  $4.07?? $4.21??  Would it really makes a difference if they just sold them for $4 or $4.20??  If I was paying cash I'd get pissed off pretty quickly with all the change.",0
2331,You NEED to try White Castle’s vanilla shake!! It’s super thick and probably their one redeeming quality,0

2346,Burger King fries really did kick ass once upon a time.,0

2370,"To me the best fries are 5 guys because of the fresh potatoes. You can REALLY taste it. Here in Florida we have a chicken chain that started with fresh potatoes, but after several years switched to frozen. So now their fries are just like everyone else. For seasoned fries Checkers/Rallys are the best. They taste great, but they ARE too greasy. Every other place to me is the same; if the fries are fresh they are good, if not they are just ""okay"".",0

My local burger joint Zoar Burger has the second best and that's only due to consistency of quality. When they are spot on, they're just like I make them at home.",0
2379,"The first rule was it has to be a national brand, and most of these are nowhere close to national chains.",0

2395,The fact that you were surprised about how bad burger kings fries are is crazy. They have been so bad for so long.,0
2396,You should do a list on fast food cheese curds. Freddy's and good times have some dank ass cheese curds imo,0
2397,Disagree with a lot of these. In these videos Josh clearly allows food to sit around and get cold and soggy before reviewing them. I’m also convinced Josh must have super high blood pressure with the amount of salt he cooks with. Nothing is ever salty enough for him. Most of these places are sickeningly salty when I eat them,0

2401,Filipinos don't even like Jollibee fries You're just afraid to be cancelled hahaha so bias to the Filipino viewers,0
2402,"I wouldn’t have used salt Contant as a factor just for the fact of a lot of fast food places purposely do not salt their fries to allow their customers to do with themselves because some people do over salt the hell out of their fries So if anything, it would’ve been more fair to grab or ax for salt packets from the fast food places if you ate it and felt as if there wasn’t enough salt 

I prefer the floppy fries so frankly, which everyone you say is the floppiest is the one I’m going to get and test for floppiness definitely going to In-N-Out for some fries gonna add salt and what not though",0

2441,"carls jr waffle fries blow cfa fries out the water, no contest.",0

They tasted more real because there was no worry about if they made you sick or not. You'd get fries cooked in beef tallow... McDonalds... and they tasted 1000% better than they do now. As more health conscious people took over and changed things, they ruined the flavor experience in eating food.",0

None of those others even come close.
the fact that you said arbys fries is better than 5 guys fries discredits  your ability to know what a good fry is.

2467,"I wish Smashburger had made the cut. Their fries are unique, and (usually) amazing.",0
2468,"I would love to know the vegetarian status of these fries. Obviously, frying in the same oil as chicken (or fish if anyone does that!) would be a no go. But there is also the oil, and then the ingredients. Many people probably don’t remember that Micky Ds fried in beef tallow, and still puts “natural” beef flavor in their fries.

Then, there is also what they are frying. We know 5 guys cuts and fries potatoes, while the golden arches is a potato puree. But what about the rest of them? Real potato or potato puree?

For my money a French fry has to be from potatoes. If you make a potato puree, it’s something else.",0
2469,"After seeing your scale, I'm definitely not trusting it.  It's all over the place. Most of us have waaaay different opinions on what a fry should taste like.",0
2470,The fries at KFC must be completely different in the US because in the UK they are notoriously bad,0
2471,Taco Bell??,0
2472,Meanwhile for me the flavour is too much on the curly fries at Arbys. Goes to show how different tastes can be. I always have them with a sauce to balance it out. haha,0

2485,I loved your reaction to DQ's fries! My local Dairy Queen just closed down and there's no other locations for miles and miles so I miss those dang fries so much!

2490,"The summer of 1970 and through my senior year in high school I worked at a small hamburger stand at a car wash. The new owner knew nothing about food service and did everything to cut costs. We would use the fry oil for so long that anything we fried (fries, rings, taquitos, burritos) would almost instantly be stained brown, making it almost impossible to tell when things were properly cooked.

Maybe I just haven't had good luck with BK (even though I've been to plenty across America) but that chain will reuse their fry oil until it's literally gone rancid...and still continue to use it. Mix in they are frying the onion rings in that same super old oil as the fries and the fries taste nasty AF.

My 2nd least favorite is Five Guys. Those are the greasiest oiliest fries that come out super hot, but the problem is they continue to cook and get steamed in the bag and end up as mushy oily gross fries. Also I'd say Five Guys fries are always WAY overly salty.",0

2534,"McDonald's fries might be the most wildly-varying fast food item. Like you mentioned, there's a huge difference in location quality from franchise to franchise. The oil, the salt level, the freshness (sometimes at lower-traffic locations, I've gotten fries that were literally colder than room temp, somehow), and how quickly the consumer eats the fries after leaving the location also impacts massively. Even fresh, my average experience is like a 6-7, and then anything more than 15 minutes from leaving the restaurant is down to a 3-4. I just think they're by far the most overrated fries out there.",0
2535,"Since most are franchise owned, the lack of standardization (and execution) is a HUGE part of it. The BK near my house - absolute GARBAGE! The BK about twice as far away in the other direction - so good the food almost looks like the AD! That being said, BK does have the most quality variation. Anyone who's lacerated the top of their mouth on one of their sourdough burgers knows Jack's has the crunch down, even on curly fries, but Chick-fil-a fries are just a vehicle for sauce and have no value on their own. DQ and CJ's are always good, KFC and McD's can be hit or miss (in my area).",0

And some are fried in oils that connect with meat, so vegetarians cannot eat them either.  However, your video may be even more valuable to these groups.

It is pretty rare that you get crisp ones too with most of them being floppy from sitting in the cardboard box that they are served in.  That said, they are my favourite fries here because the seasoning is just so damn tasty.  Unfortunately you really need to find a store that seasons the fries properly because there is a massive variance in how well they are salted store by store - some stores the fries taste like they forgot to put seasoned salt on them and in other stores it seems like you ordered some fries to go with your seasoned salt but then you find that golden store that always seasons their fries perfectly and you go out of your way to go to that store even if there are closer stores...",0

ate very fresh. These can stand up to being some GREAT fries, but for the other 80+ percent of the time, I will have to agree with Joshua, and say these are nowhere near the winner.

Five guys has that fresh potato taste and is usually seasoned well, while having a slightly firm exterior. That's about perfect for me.",0

3095,Portillos Cheese fries,0

3097,"Well, I have to say that some of this list can't be replicated where I live. 
We don't have Freddy's, Jolibee, Jack in The Box, Shake Shack, A&W, Del Taco, Wienershnitzel, Habit Burger, our Steak & Shakes are sit-down restaurants so I don't count them, White Castle and In N' Out just don't exist here. Chick-Fil-A is controversial, so I just don't eat there. Also, greasiness in the South is a feature, not a bug. So I'll rate them in order to what's available on my experience and from family/friends think.

1) Checkers/Rallys - We are home to the very first Checkers restaurant in America, so we're partial to them. Again, greasiness is a feature.
2) KFC - I'm only putting KFC at 2 because I haven't had them, but I know people who swear by them. We don't have many KFCs because our local chicken establishments do way better chicken, so I default to Checkers when I'm craving fries.
3) Taco Bell - WHEN THEY'RE AVAILABLE Taco Bell's Nacho Fries have the best flavor even without the cheese. A little on the soggy side, but so good. I would've loved to see how'd they fare in this video.
4) Arby's - Needs a little more salt and they can be dry, but the crunch makes up (curly only).
5) Popeyes - All my experiences with Popeyes fries have been a little on the soggy end, but oh-so-flavorful.
6) McDonald's - If they're fresh, they're the best non-seasoned fry.
7) Zaxby's - We can be partial to crinkle cut and Zaxby's adds that flavor. Never had a problem with them.
8) Culver's - A much less flavorful fry than Zaxby's, but they're solid.
9) Raising Canes - Just fine. Really close to Culver's in quality.
10) Carl's Jr/Hardee's - I've never seen or had their waffle fries, so I can only rate their standard fry - which is pretty meh.
11) Whataburger - Mostly just salt, but there's a fry in there...somewhere.
12) Burger King - Kinda like the texture, which is unique, but that's all they have.
13) Wendy's - The most mid fry, ever. Can't hate it that much but can't like it enough.
14) Sonic - I don't hate Sonic fries, but they do nothing for me. I always get tots. It's the better option.
15) Bojangles - I've never gotten decent fries from our local Bojangles. Always hard and flavorless.
16) DQ - They must've changed their fry formula, because DQ always used to have some of the worst fries. I've always avoided them. 
17) Five Guys - Either fry is trash. It's a bag of soggy crap and fried paper mixed together. Peanut oil doesn't work with fries and that's what my local one uses.
18) Church's - I think they use bad oil on purpose. They always taste bad, but so does their chicken. Adding Texas to their name just makes me hate it more. Everything they make is bland, so the bad oil is the only thing giving it flavor.",0
3098,"This comparison is almost not even worth doing because it really depends on the location. I guess maybe it gives some sort of relevant overview. But the most worthwhile thing here is knowing that you can order In N Out fries 'well done'. I feel like you have to be a bit of an asshole to order fries in any special way, because they're typically all made exactly the same, so you're inevitably creating extra work/stress for the underpaid and unappreciated employees",0

3133,"I'm very glad that Josh's no. 1 fry is the same fry we use at my workplace because those things are Really good. If you know what they are, you can tell just by looking at them. We aren't even in the fast food game but getting those over every other fry we have ever had has been such a pleasant surprise. For like $3 for half a pound of fries, they're easily the number one thing my coworkers order on the daily (with cheese or bacon or buffalo chicken or whatever).",2

3137,I guess it depends on the location.  KFC fries have always been absolutely terrible for me.,0
3138,No taco bell nacho fries??,0
3139,"Just from the visual alone, I knew those McDonalds fries were going to slap so hard. Which is extremely disappointing because every single McDonalds in my area have very lackluster fries. They either come out cold, soggy, and grainy, or extremely under salted as if they tried to rub the residual salt at the bottom of the fry pan for salt. Which is a real shame, because I really do think nothing beats a properly done McDonald's fries when it comes to standard fries (not counting seasoned, curly, or criss-cut fries).",0

3141,"I'm sure comments like this are dime a dozen, but sad you didn't go to Penn Station... they're moderately national and do have more than 300+ locations. When I worked there 15+ years ago they were using fresh-cut, par-boiled (and then frozen), with a second fry method. It was my introduction to that technique before I ever saw it in anywhere fancy. Your method isn't wrong, I just want you to try MY favorite hah",0

3153,"One of my worst experiences with french fries came from a KFC. Fries were cold, greasy, and tasted straight bitter from the oil. Good to hear they can be delicious, I'll make a point to try them at a different location. 

Also props to Popeyes for having an incredibly flavourful fry at the cost of load of oil in every bite lol, easily the most bittersweet of favorite fries.",0

3159,"FIVE GUYS FRIES ARE THE FUCKING BEST. No, they aren't the ""crispiest"" overall,  but they are the most flavorful and decadent. Let's face it, the ""crispiest"" fries are either something you need to eat hot out of the frier (yay) or some batter-dipped utter BS trash disaster. The Five Guys fry style is what we call ""boardwalk fries"" here in NJ. Hand cut, skin on, and double-fried in peanut oil. Put some malt on those babies and dip them in ketchup and cheese if you like. You don't even need the cajun seasoning.  All of this being said, I live in the NE, and while well traveled, there are a few places on your list that I've never tried or haven't tried in years. When hot out of the fryer, I love the F out of McD's and Chick-fil-A.",0

3167,KFC has my favorite fries but they look different here in illinois. they look almost like the rallys fries. your culvers fries had to have been cooked differently than the ones near me because here they area always perfect.,0

3175,"Steak and Shake here are salted well.
I think it’s all in the franchise owner. 
McD here used to be good but then they switched Franchise owners and everything is crap. Bread is stale, employees are rude. But if I go to another city, it’s better.

3189,Josh you can order Chick-fil-A fries well done too.  It’s a game changer as well,0
3190,I think rating each component of the fry then adding up to a total would give you more consistent and logical ranking. It's a bit all over the place opinion to score given,0

3194,bojangles deserves a 10,0
3195,"Man. It's rough with this. Day to day, time of day, location, and so much can change the qualities they were looking for. McDonald's is usually floppy and greasy with a little bitter and either too salty or not salty at all. Then, on that rare occasion,  they are pretty alright. Then they are all burnt a little... more or less applies to all of these places. Jack in the box curly have never let me down personally though.",0

Never thought I'd disagree so hard with the #1 pick here. KFC's fries make me feel as though my mouth has been teleported to the middle of the Sahara. Popeyes biscuits don't even desiccate my mouth so much. The texture? Barely any crisp. Soggy right out the fryer. The flavor? Too much salt, and this is coming from someone who thinks McDonald's fries could use some more. Their potato wedges weren't even that good, and yet I'd rather have them than the fries. A 2.5 at most from me, mind-blowing to see an 8.7 and an 8.8 from you gentlemen.",0

3389,"I wonder if the vast differences in the fry experience is down to the...philosophy, if you will.  Are your fries intended to be eaten alone, or with ketchup?  Or maybe even your own sauce?  Perhaps they're intended to be eaten in tandem with the hamburger, or whatever your specialty is?

Zaxby's fries for example are indeed less than meh on their own, but dipped in Zax sauce or ranch, they're some of my favorites.  Arby's curlies are fine alone, but I always put both ketchup and their Horsey sauce on them and they're even better.  We don't have a White Castle where I live, but Krystal is the equivalent, and while their fries are limp and greasy, they pair very well with the Cheese Krystal and the Chiks.  (And also you can get them covered in chili and cheese for a blissful grease coma, precisely the thing when you're drunk at 3am.  There's a reason Krystals are 24 hour places.)",0

3867,"Why Arby's uses a hat (found on Google josh) 😅: Arby's logo is a cowboy hat because the restaurant's first logo was designed to represent the iconic 10-gallon hat worn by cowboys in old spaghetti westerns. The logo was first introduced in 1964, when westerns were popular, and has carried over into redesigns. The logo was changed to the famous red hat in 1976, and the hat was sometimes yellow until 1993.

Hatchwise

The Complete History Of The Arby's Logo - Hatchwise

In 1964, when the restaurant was first established, westerns were incredibly popular and the brand thought it was a good idea to incorporate it into their logo. The cowboy hat served as the base of the design and ended up carrying over into their redesigns.

Quora

What is so special about Arby's logo? - Quora

May 12, 2019 — It's all about the hats and history. Arby's logo, initially, was designed to represent that iconic ten-gallon hat. You know, the kind cowboys in old spaghetti westerns would wear while sauntering into some saloon in a one-horse town. That's no accident.

￼

Logopedia

Arby's | Logopedia | Fandom

1976–2012. ... In March 1976, the logo was changed to the famous red hat. Until 1993, the hat was sometimes colored yellow while the text remained red. Slogans used alongside this logo were ""Satisfy your grown-up tastes"" (2001-2003) ""What Are You Eating Today?"", ""Every Day Tastes So Good"", ""I'm Thinking Arby's"", (2005-2009) ""Worth Every Penny"" (2009-2010), ""It's An Arby's Thing"" (2010-2011) and ""It's Good Mood Food"" (2011-2012). It is still used in many locations. This logo was still used for their kids meal until 2013.

The cowboy hat may represent Arby's close relationship with fresh beef, promising high quality. 

Arby's original sign makers, Peskin Sign Co., designed the logo. Less than 100 of the original Arby's cowboy hat signs remain in the United States, with Texas being one of the few states where they can be found.",0

4021,"Bro, the reason why Jollibee did not fare well in your I tried every burger in America video is because YOU CHOSE THE WRONG BURGER TO REPRESENT JOLLIBEE!!!

You should've ordered their Champ burger!

You ordered the Yum burger, the very burger that Jollibee made for the masses because not many Filipinos can afford a Whopper or BigMac-sized burger unlike Americans!!!

It's also the same reason why the burger of the Yum burger is not that thick unlike a Whopper and why it does not have any toppings aside from ketchup and mayonnaise.",0

Long John Silvers can have an A to S tier plain ""normal"" fry if you get a good batch + you can cheat and eat the batter chucks they always give you with the fries for a boost of mega crunch.   My Local (north of ATX) KFC is likely to cause ☠or 🤮 for sure.  Our small town/rural DQs are good to great depending on location, try the tacos...another subject of debate among many.

Would it be better if they just did this normally? Yes!  Also I will say that burger king has a HUGE problem with location consistency...The one by my house is one of the best.

not an objective video by any definition, and only from 4 minutes in its clear how badly biased this is.
granted its his video, he's allowed to have biases, but dear god make it less about the bias and score similar things similarly.",1
4214,Find it kind of weird papa meat made a video 4 HOURS after this about trying ALL the chicken sandwiches 😅,0
4215,We go to DQ just for fries and a shake to dip them in.,0
4216,"About @ Freddy's Steakburgers, she asked you if you wanted Fry Sauce, which is a specific condiment. Very surprised Josh doesn't know about it. It's simply mayo mixed with ketchup. 27:30",0
4217,"All of these are regional 😂 except Bk , Wendy’s, Arby’s, chick fil a, McDonald’s 😊",0
4218,"The other advantage to ordering well done is that...if they are not super fresh and were sitting under the lamp for a bit, they will likely have to re-fry them for a minute. In turn, you get either super fresh or twice fried fries. Win win in my book.",0
4219,wing stop?,0
4220,Fast food 🤢🤮,0
4221,Kinda wish they would have thrown in Sonic's tater tots in there too for comparison. Also cus idk anyone who orders their fries everyone I know orders their tots as the side.,0
4222,"In the uk, this would be a not-get grossed out or throw up challenge",0
4223,In N  Out - Why isn't well done fries just the default? 😂 Seems like a no brainer...,0
4224,Yeah had kfc fries recently there actually pretty lit 🔥,0
4225,Note I'm in Canada so it's a bit different but I'd 100 agree that KFC has the best fast food fries... 15 years ago lol at some point they switched from those lightly breaded fries and now they're just awful honestly one of the worst fries now,0
4226,Being called a “big fan of Filipinos” might have been the highlight of Josh’s career,0
4227,I do like KFC fries. Much better than when they used to do wedges. Usually get them with the nuggets and dip in the sauce instead of ketchup.,0
4228,Too be fair canes assumes you’ll be dipping them in canes sauce,0
4229,"I used to work at DQ and we often were changing out the grease !  Our bosses were trained at headquarters in I think Minneapolis? And they were 100% by the book with their machines and fryers etc, we hated it but if we went out to empty the grease , we could sneak a smoke, yep that was backin 85 lol 😆",0
4230,"Havent finished the video but if Five Guys doesn't win I will forever distrust your sense of taste. They have the best fries on the *planet*, hands down, zero contest, not even remotely close.",0
4231,Come to India....bitch 😂😂,0
4232,Five guy has the best fries,0
4233,What about chicken express…,0
4234,you gotta try the fries at joes bbq here in KC. such good seasoning,0
4235,"DQ has a high score probably cuz they don't sell as many fried foods as the other chains, so their oil is fresher and the fries are made fresher? As a Canadian who only had a few of these chains, McDonald's is always gonna be my number 1 fries though.",0
4236,It’s a shame the UK KFC have gone down a route of skin on fries and they are horrible!,0
4237,"bro says he's not doing regional chains, immediately goes to in-n-out and Wienerschnitzel and later jack in the box that are all regional exclusives to the west coast",19
4238,white castle stay losing. it's that karma for still partnering with autism speaks,0
4239,"Freddy's fries are exactly what I've been hoping for at Inn-N-Out for years. They're still so thin, so they come out really fast, but because they are so long, they are amazing and keep their heat decently. Cup style packaging is also great, and fry sauce is better than animal sauce. Inn-N-Out should change from their terrible cold matchstick fries to Freddy's style.",0
4240,One of these days Josh let Vikram cook and it was the best decision of his life.,0
4241,"freddy's fries are literally one of my favorite foods on this planet, i could eat those every day for every meal.",0
4242,A lot of these were filmed right by the outlet I work at!,0
4243,In N Out should come in dead last.,0
4244,"Hot take, crinkle cut fries are not good. Especially del taco fries",0
4245,I am disregarding these results because Popeye's is my favorite with Checker's as a close second because their fries are basically the same 🗿,0
4246,"I feel like you need another rating metric, and that is 'how do these fries hold up 40 minutes later after youve driven home and are ready to eat your meal because not that many people eat in the parking lot'.",0
4247,He has horrible taste in fries!,0
4248,What about cookout???????,0
4249,"You finally stop sleeping on DQ's fries and look what happens. They don't really do anything else very well, but their fries are FIRE.",0
4250,Wait in n out fries are not good? I like them! Lol,0
4251,no wingstop ???,0
4252,Jollibee is the best,1
4253,"Greetings from Europe  - Wiener Schnitzel best (eat more meat and less potatoes  - no wait, wasn't it the other way?  )",0
4254,"I am not a fan of crinkle cut fries, but Cane's is the only restaurant that does it well. You need to get a fresh batch that is salted properly.",0
4255,"Wait, Arby's has regular fries?",0
4256,Your a Barbarian fast food tester,1
4257,Josh gotta come to Australia and try Schnitz. Crunch is insane and doused in chicken salt. God tier.,0
4258,"I'm from Australia and the best fries from my country would be either Hungry Jack's, Carl's Jr or Lord of the Fries. LotF is a 100% vegan fast food place btw",0
4259,I know you are American but you should expand. The best fry in the world is for sure Red Rooster,0
4260,LOL the amount of effort that went into this wow,0
4261,Totally not biased at all /s,0
4262,Tots are better,0
4263,"I dunno, I really like five guys.",1
4264,"This is a mind-blowing video. The worst shops had the best fries. KFC was unexpected, as their fries are so bad in the UK I don't even eat them. McDonald's is my #1, but Shake Shack is a very close second. I'm taking a mental note to try KFC fries when I go to Florida post-graduation.",0
4265,Curly is cheating,0
4266,"I am so glad Josh loves Freddy’s!  They are my favorite chain burger and I love their seasoned, skinny crispy fries. They are bomb.",0
4267,Idkk I think the obvious texture is not being crunchy for fast food,0
4268,17:58 sounds like a ruined * bleep * if I've ever heard one,0
4269,"Dude, what is with the hate on DQ!? I have never ever had a bad experience from DQ. Most years I get an ice cream cake from them for my b-day. Also, dig the non gimmick-ey dinner vibe to everything. Especially burgers and frozen options.",0
4270,"Salt level is a preposterous metric for fast-food fry evaluation, it's merely dependent on what the operator of the salt dispenser feels like doing to that particular batch.",0
4271,"A lot of surprises, but the thing I'm most surprised with is how much you didn't like Five Guys frys.  My wife and I love their fries.  Our faves by far.",0
4272,"Filipinos are a big fan of you too, Joshua! Any chance you can try to cook Turon?

…

If you do, do NOT use Cavendish bananas, they’re tasteless by Filipino standards.",0
4273,No in and out in Missouri,0
4274,In-N-Out burgers: amazing. Their fries: Hot garbage. The only menu item that could use an upgrade IMO,0
4275,Rally’s is the best fries. Period!!!,0
4276,"YESSSSSSSSSSSSS HAHAHAHA

 I LOVE YOU JOSHUA <3 <3 <3",0
4277,No surprise Whataburger destroyed In-N-Out.  Animal style fries don't count and its a cheat to make their fries not taste like cardboard.,1
4278,"Re: BK's shitty fries; it's true. When I buy from BK, I order their pretty good onion rings instead of their crappy fries.",0
4279,American fast food places need to learn about the miracle that is Australian Chicken Salt. It is the seasoning that turns an average fry into a gourmet delight that you would fight to the death over.,2
4280,"Josh constantly going to New York for White Castle is a slap in the face. White Castle is a midwestern staple, go to Illinois for your White Castle ffs!",0
4281,In n out fries are the only actual real fry lol the others are fake potato,0
4282,no wingstop is sacrilege,0
4283,"I’m quite suprised Jollibee topped 5 in the Fries category in America, meanwhile it’s the complete opposite here in the Philippines it’s mediocre at best(Special exemption are the limited editions fries they sell)",1
4284,"That’s funny, don’t remember In-n-out being a “national” chain.",0
4285,"Zaxbys is only good for wings and salads. Honestly, I hate salads but they have the best fast food salad in the game. which is saying something because Wendy's has always had a killer cesar salad. However some people would say a cesar salad is cheating. It would say you are wrong when you get the blue salad with tongue torch chickens and extra bleu cheese crumbles. Hell, might be the best salad I know of in fast food and sit down, until you go somewhere like The Olive Garden. I think the best fry is seasoned waffle fries, seasoned curly fries, cajun fries from Cookout, and the seasoned potato wedges that KFC used to sell when they also had bomb ass buffalo wings and then a month later you could only get a mini buffalo chicken zinger which is not a crispy dark meat wing with the perfect skin to meat ratio. And the texas petes. God, I may not be 350 lbs anymore but my wants and needs have not changed.",1
4286,Wendys  is f**king trash,0
4287,"Coastal New England, Connecticut doesn’t count, any place that sells fried shellfish will have the most amazing fries, also the local pizza place has spinach and pepperoni calzone, light on the pep, heavy on the moz, with extra, extra sauce on the side. And you also get fries and clams.",0
4288,A&W in Canada doesn’t have that fry anymore… we have “russet thick cut fries”… I miss those fries that you guys had. 😢,0
4289,"I loved this, but tbh y'all are over-indexing on salt level in your scores. I agree a good fry is salty, but it's the easiest factor for the customer to adjust (add salt) and is also the most variable, i.e. one employee could've salted more or less, or you just got a scoop of fries where their salt sprinkle didn't cover well.

Also, in n out normal fries = limp, and well done = burnt, but 'light well' = perfect. Add some of their extra fine salt and you've got a winner.",0
4290,"I'm a weirdo, I kinda like soft fries. I think five guys is my favorite.",2
4291,Which McDonald’s did you go to seriously???,0
4292,"I'm convinved I have the best Wendys, because their fries ALWAYS hit. Super hot and salty and delicious.",1
4293,In ‘n’ Out and Five Guys have the same problem.,0
4294,"Here's a tip for the most crispiest fries you can possibly get.
ALWAYS Order fries WITHOUT Salt. They will have to make a new batch and give it to you.",0
4295,"this video was good but it probably could've done without the constant digs towards minimum wage workers, keep that shit to yourself dawg",0
4296,"I’m gluten free so I pretty much only eat at chick fil for fast food out of most of these, but yeah their fries need sauce. Love them but sauce is necessary. But to me sauce is always necessary",0
4297,No cookout?,0
4298,At sonic the best things are tots and cheese sticks in my opinion,0
4299,All fries are good. It depends very much on the cook - like how they are cooked.,0
4300,You should be exiled from Texas for hating whataburger. Get this heretic out of my state.,0
4301,Freddy's fries are top tier when fresh,0
4302,Nah every KFC fry i have ever had has been the soggiest wettest fry ever 😝,0
4303,recalling biting your tongue lol. must have been really painful 😂,0
4304,"Honestly, extra crispy Culvers fries with their ranch is my favorite",0
4305,"These videos are super fun, Joshua, but I do miss the recipe videos.  Any possibility you could go to Japan, try the 7-11 egg salad sandwiches, and teach us how to make them from scratch?  I suspect your milk bread recipe will feature 😀",3
4306,Im with Josh on this one. I've never eaten at a good white castle. They dont exist.,0
4307,"Very interesting results. Didn't expect the eventual winner because their fries are pretty not great in Canada. As far as Canadian fast food fries go, A&W is at the top for me. Skin-on, thick cut, crunchy outside, soft inside, nice flavour, nicely salted.",0
4308,u made Filipinos/filipinas proud and happy with that rating🙌🙌🙌,0
4309,We are 4 restaurants in and 3 are not National lmao what a turd,0
4310,"Was actually hoping that I would see DQ fries in there. I know Josh isn't a big fan of the place, but their fries are actually top tier.",0

4319,I wish you judged cookout fries. They might not have won but I would've loved your review!,0
4320,I loved all the French fry pimple popper shots.,0
4321,No offense but NOT EVERYBODY IS A FUCKING CONNOISSEUR LIKE YOU GUYS . Just because something tastes bad to you doesn’t mean everybody hates it,0
4322,making the requirements to be a national chain and starting off with 2 burger joints that dont touch anything north or east of texas is fucking crazy. Whats the point of having a requirement if you're just going to ignore it.,1
4323,Why did you fly to NY when you could have went to Scottsdale Arizona where a White Castle just opened not too long ago.,0
4324,"What I gather from this is, on any day, many of these fast food places can have a top tier fry. As long as the oil is fresh, the salt level is correct, they have been fried properly and served hot. You should have yourself a decent fry. If any one of those things are off, then the quality of the fry drops considerably.",0
4325,"Uhm,  I appreciate when a drive thru has a special treat option for my doggo 🤷🏼‍♀️",0
4326,"KFC had a massive shift for whatever reason. They used to be known for their chicken whereas their fries are utter dogshit but now, idk what they did but their fries are amazing and their chicken was the one that got a huge switcheroo and feels like crap. 

What the actual fuck KFC... How did you even pull that shit off?!",0
4327,BOJANGLES SNUBBED 10/10 BEST FRIES,0
4328,I went to Rally's  in Cleveland because I was craving a Big Buford. And they had the AI machine and my girlfriend doesn't like onions. So when I ordered hers it wouldn't let me take away anything. It just kept going. I was pissed the F off because no human was taking my order. AI can't do what we do so I left and loved a crappier review that there are AI. I is pushing people away. If you can't talk to it and fix your order how you want it because it's only doing the basic order then I'm not going,0

Maybe to be fair you should order a no salt at each chain..that will also ensure fresh 🤷‍♂️",0

4349,"The best fast food fries I've had were from a DcMonalds in the middle of nowhere Arizona on a rainy day. The solo lady working there had an issue with the timer and had to ""eyeball"" when they were finished.",0

4355,"This was really a great test.  It was consistent and revealed the quality of takeout fries.  Everyone can talk about consistency, but that only happens at the takeout window when no one is paying attention.  Quality of product still reigns.  Great review.",3

4414,"As soon as I saw this video, I had my own opinions:

1) DQ fries are slept on, and I'm glad that they ranked highly and got the recognition that they deserve.
2) Five Guys fries are trash, from my own experience. Everyone around talks about how great they are, but the ones I've been to have given me bags of grease with potato ""spaghetti"" in them.
3) Rally's fries are amazing, but you can literally feel your arteries getting clogged when you eat them. You only order Fry Lovers XL if you have a deathwish (if you don't know, it's a large cup full of their fries).
4) I know Taco Bell doesn't regularly serve fries, but it would have been fun to rank them against the others, because I think they have great seasoning and texture depending on where you get them from.
5) I think that a burger place loses credibility if their fries aren't done well. It takes away from the experience if I have a really good burger but a bad fry. I'm a sides guy, though. Love me some sides.",0

4437,wtf that arbys is down the road from me lol,0
4438,The second I saw the five guys score I knew this was a paid ad for Jollibee and Jack In The Box. Five Guys bodies every other fry in the universe and its not even close.,0
4439,KFC fries are my favorite as well. Wendy's breakfast Seasoned Potatoes are also very good if made correctly.,0
4440,That Root Beer Rolex though 👀,0
4441,"Honestly if we're comparing fries, the non-fries will always win (Carl's waffle fries, Jack in the Box curly fries, etc). They are honestly outliers, where even somewhere like Arby's has curly fries. 
I've also found pretty varying quality levels depending on the particular restaurant you frequent. For example, Del Taco and Wienerschnitzel in my neck of the woods make BY FAR the worst fries in existence. That, and anywhere selling the crinkle cut variety is rarely good.",0
4442,"This video lowkey pissed me off. Pretty much 100% of ur scores offended me.🤣 All jokes, but seriously…",0
4443,I wish half of these places were in my town. XD,0
4444,"Mehhh, that's dumb. You shouldn't give someone a 2 over a tantrum. BK fries are totally fine, and it takes a lot for me to admit that fries aren't all just boring and bland. They're a little salty, a little crunchy, a little puffy: fine.",0
4445,Wendy’s can be a 0-10 depending on who’s working there. I had a Wendy’s that was amazing and fast everytime a certain manager was there. Then she left and the place was crap and I spent about 25 minutes in a drive thru with maybe 3 other cars.,0

4450,"In almost 50 years of life BK has never made a decent fry, though they had real onion rings when I was a kid.

Never ate at a Jack in the Box without ending up violently ill.",0
4451,Can you guys continue to hide the scores from each other. I feel like hearing the scores make it biased,0
4452,You literally go one place and assume that they make fries like that for all the fast food restaurants.  Most places you have to ask for salt packets and add salt to them but McDonald's actually tends to be the best fries if eaten hot once cold better just throw them away.,0

4474,"What about greasy fries. Here in Quebec, Canada, it's fairly common fries you use for poutine. Especially red potatoes (sweet) that makes the best one.

And, most fast food are using frozen fries where the taste is easely lost.

And, about potato taste, they are the best.",0
4475,"For Steak N Shake, you gotta add their seasoned salt to the fries most of the time",0

4490,Love how he shits all over DQ for having dog posters to later found out that it was cause of the pup cups,0
4491,"I love how you said that the restaurant COULDN'T be a regional chain and had to have a ""national presence"", and you immediately start off with In-N-Out Burger, which is absolutely a regional chain and not at all national (it's only in 6 or 7 states, mainly west and southwest US, mostly in California). You then go to Weinerschnitzel's, which I've never even heard of but turns out it's ALSO regional (mainly CA and TX with a handful of locations in a few other states). Then Whataburger which is also...wait for it...a regional chain (in only about 10 states, overwhelmingly in TX, though it's finally expanding after all these years). So, you broke your second rule in your first 3 stops. Do you not understand the meanings of the words you're using or were your rules just bullshit to troll the audience?",1

gotta say their fries in france were better than in NA, joshua needs a world patate tour",0
4500,"I’m glad ya’ll did this video only to rate the chik fila fries.  

I like the company and their values but I always thought their waffle fries were a miss, just average not worth the premium and that was confirmed here.  

Thank you!",0
4501,"Nailed raising canes, might be the most unseasoned food in America",0
4502,"Gotta rate chik-fil-a higher for me. If you get them when theyre fresher theyre much more crispy. Also, a whole meal on their own. Cant deny the sauce too.",0
4503,I HATE KFC,0

4505,"I know they’re not fast food, and including them would open the door for dozens of other quick-service chains you’d also have to include, but I wish Josh would have allowed Wingstop into the competition.

Easily one of the best fries you can get out there (at least when you get them fresh and don’t sog up in the bags they put them in). Their fry seasoning has a bit of sugar in it that makes them absolutely incredible",0

4519,"Ah, the legendary fast food french fry. As I am 70, I was blessed to have been around when the amazing McDonald's fries cooked in beef tallow existed, and sadly ended in 1990 when it was considered too high in cholesterol and replaced with vegetable oil. I am positive that you would have, hands down, chosen those fries over all the others because they were the total package, flavor, crunch, texture, amazingly great. Have not had a better fry since then. RIP beef tallow.",230
4520,I think Josh should do an episode where he tries to make the best looking thing that tastes like nothing. That white castle fry was surprising and interesting that it was crispy and absolutely taste free. Would be a fun video.,0

4526,"Over half are not ""nation wide"" but I 100% agree with KFC, I remember getting a free fry when they first started them and thinking ""these cant be good"" was blown away at how good they are. KFC kind of a potato company more than Chicken now lol",0

4547,"As much as I want to like Five Guys, I just can’t. Sure, they have a lot of add-on options, but they don’t season their patties, and the fries are just limp. Even when I asked for them to be extra crispy, they were just darker and still limp.",0
4548,But not everyone can eat them! A lot of fast food places dip their fries in something which makes it so people with allergies can't eat them. It's a very frustrating thing! 😩😩,0

For the uninitiated chicken salt is basically concentrated chicken stock powder mixed with MSG.",16

B) you’re patently wrong on White Castle. The thing that carries the weight is the breakfast options. You need to get the fried bologna sliders. It’s greasy and soaks the previous night up, but they also crack the eggs (actual eggs) for the order. Has no business being as good as it is.",92

Burger Kings were the best of the 3 but its been a while since I have had any so I cant compare to the other 2.

4910,"For me fast foods fries are almost all of them from frozen fries that comes in bags and full of chemicals and cooked in the cheapest oils and some have added anti-foam agents to preserve their oils 🤢🤮 For me i always loved fries in Québec, Canada, from a place called Lafleur, they had been in business since 1951. They always made their fries at each locations with red potatoes, freshly peeled and cut at each locations each day, no chemicals, no agents, just cooked fries. Their taste as always remained the same for me since i was 8 years old and i am now 57 years old LOL Lafleur also have their own hotdogs sausages and sell them in grocery stores throughout Québec as well. McDonald's have good fries 40 years ago for fast foods, but they had gotten worst and worst through the years. I had worked in an distribution center of McDonald's in Montréal, it was clean but they only receive orders for all McDonald's in Québec. All their foods are frozen and they have huge freezers that are below 0 degrees and below. Burger King are the same and their employees here have always been idiots and shouldn't even be cooking any foods at all. Harvey's used to be good but their fries were always bad, onion rings have always be the one for me. But for me it will never make any sense for all of their prices today, they say it is because of the salaries of employees, inflation etc, but for me i think a lot of fast foods chains will be closed by the end of the year.",0

B) you’re patently wrong on White Castle. The thing that carries the weight is the breakfast options. You need to get the fried bologna sliders. It’s greasy and soaks the previous night up, but they also crack the eggs (actual eggs) for the order. Has no business being as good as it is.",1

If they could figure out how to make them crunchier then they'd be 10/10 but they've always been a bit flaccid and I'm also not a huge fan of home cut style with the skin. My guess is they use a waxy potato because of how sweet it is which is also probably why it's not very crunchy. Next time you go, get a cheddar-bo biscuit and a bo-berry biscuit. They always make the cheddar-bo fresh and it's perfect every single time. (at least in the ~dozen locations I've been to in NC) Also highly recommend their seasoning that you can get from their website. I mix equal parts bojangles seasoning, tony's creole, lawry's seasoning salt, knorr chicken bouillon and old bay. best fry seasoning there is (also insanely good chicken brine)",1

there's a ton of random locations for all the big chains around here that suffer from that, but several that do just fine. there's  no real way for a super small sample size to capture it properly.

In and out might be the most overrated burger in America and yes their fries stink.  Was nothing special, I don't get the love for that place.  Anyone who is just starting out learning to grill can make one as good if not better...  But out of all of them, they might use the freshest ingredients.


Chick-fil-A is the worst fries I've ever had, they always come cold and mushy.  You cannot even ask for them well done by me.

Mc Donald's used to have a specific system for cooking fries, they taught us back in the 70s when our school went on a field trip there.  They had to be cooked for a specific time, at a specific temp and thrown out after a specific amount of sitting (I thought it was 3 mins, but it was a long time ago).  Now you have to order them well done to get that old school feel and taste, but regardless they're always different depending on what location and time you go.  And, now they are 5 bucks for a large... What's that 1/2 to maybe 1 potato?  Imagine having to work nearly an entire hour to afford 1.

Checkers used to have the best seasoned fries, but they closed down all of them by me now...

White Castle... LOL you only go there at 2am when you're inebriated, and then it tastes awesome.  It's another place that you pay for the next day and if you sleep with a significant other you might just want to spare them and sleep in another room.  Their fries are always exactly like yours were.  My entire family goes there when we meet up (once or twice a decade) so we can compete with the worst smelling flatulence... We have a weird family =).  We found if you drink a 6 pack of Old Style and down a 12 pack of their cheeseburgers, the combo is enough to make the dog leave the room.

I love french fries (if you haven't noticed) I bought a deep frier during COVID and either use JWs Mc Donald's recipe (if I have the time to make and freeze a bunch) or buy the Idaho frozen ones.  They both are easy and come out great at home, and I can cook them to any crispiness I want...",0

Your bugerking fries sucked so bad and yet the closest BK to me have great fries even though we prefer to go to the nearby McDs for fries as they arent ""battered"" fries. 
Now the 2 closest Tacobells you would 100% rate in the 2s but there are 2 other Tacobells that are a few more miles away but everything they make us a 9 or 10. The first 2 Tbells tacos and such look like they are filled to the bare minimum and below what you should get, and then the further 2 Tbells load everything up fat as hell and everything just simply tastes better and fresher. 
So its all about hyper specific locations rathet than the chains overall. It does suck there isnt a standard thats upheld so no matter where you go the food tastes the same and always good and fresh. However it matters more about the employees thus location matters most. A top notch manager is going to put out superior products than a manager that doesnt give a shit. So because of this 99% of your ratings for anything like this is invalid unless you taste test every location and figure out an average overall score for the thing youre ranking.",0

The fries were excellent.

The above may sound like a ridiculous meal but this was me working noon to close in the largest Arby's in Texas (Northeast Mall in North Richland Hills) and I NEEDED those calories just to not lose weight from my already thin frame.

I think McDonalds is much more strict about keeping their fries the same no matter where in the world, because thats their consistency. KFC doesn't have that strict rule. While the KFC fries here are skin-on fries and when you get them fresh and hot they can be amazing but they can also be hit and miss depending on the restaurant. 

With McDonalds I've always had a consitent french fry even going to different stores.",0
5485,you know it makes sense that DQ fries are fresh and probably fried in new oil. I mean what else are they gonna fry? ice cream? and no one orders fries from them that it has got to be made fresh.,0
5486,Ummmmm. Checkers/Rallys?,0
5487,Is it weird that I knew which Jolibee he went to based on the Conns and the Walmart? Maybe it’s because my dad used to live behind that Walmart or maybe it’s because the SA one is the closest to Austin lol,0

5490,The best rated fries are consistently the freshest made fry... so many great fries got steam rolled by F tier fries because you happened to roll through when the most recent batch was getting old. I want a top 10 re-match but you only order them RIGHT when the store opens >.>,0
5491,"National presence you say? I’ve never heard of Steak and Shake, Zaxbys, Del taco, Wienerscnitzel, Rally’s, or Habit Burger.  I’ve heard of Church’s, In and Out and Jack in the Box, but I have never seen either one on the east coast, maybe I’m wrong.  If it were just one or two I never heard of, I could let it slide without calling it out, but this many!?!",1

5496,Jolibee took over one of the Chris n Pitt’s restaurants in California. They were the best bbq ever. There’s only 2 locations left! The prime rib is so good there. One in bellflower is the original restaurant and it looks the same. You should try it if you’re ever out here.,0
5497,if wendys fries isnt at the top of youir list ur wrong,0
5498,McDonald's fries aren't  even  made  from  a  regular kind of  potato and if you want  the freshest  🍟  order them with no salt,0
5499,The Tampa region has a Jolibee but it is in a weird outlying town called Pinellas Park 40 minutes away so I can order it on Uber Eats but I haven't because I am going to get it an hour after it is  cooked seems like I would be setting myself up for failure,0

5510,"The biggest problem with this sort of thing is that, despite the efforts big companies put into consistency, in practical application who makes the best _anything_  really depends heavily on where you are. In my area, McDonald's fries get absolutely _destroyed_ by Burger King, the Chick-Fil-A managers personally taste-test the fries and adjust seasonings so they're near-perfect every time, the KFC consistently earns one-star reviews, Whataburger's fries are dynamite but their burgers are always mushy, the nearest Dairy Queen is 45 minutes away, the three closest Hardees have all been closed for multiple years, and there's none of half of the entries on the list anywhere in the entire state.",0

5999,"I didn't have time to check all of the recipes, but I did compare prices for 3 of them, living in Washington (blue) state and that's what I found out:
Walmart prices (so one of the cheapest options. +/- 2 cents rounded). 
First recipe: Bucatini – $5.88. Unsalted butter - $4 – 9.88 total price (so twice as much). BUT if you use angel hair pasta, instead of Bucatini, you can get it for $1.76, which brings to a total of $5.76, which is much closer + 10% sales taxes. 

3rd: Chicken Stock – 2.92 for a better brand, 1.37 for a Walmart brand. Pastina: 3.94 (but I think you can find a Mexican style for 2). Unsalted butter - $4. Shredded parm (no one would buy not shredded one, c’mon) – 3.68 for a total of around 11$  + 10% sales taxes, so with shredded cheese can make it even cheaper. 

5th: Parmigiano Reggiano – 7. Unsalted butter - $4, garlic – 1.70. Spaghetti – 1.76. Fish sauce – 7.20. Soy sauce – 1.60 (Walmart brand. Not a Walmart brand – 3.60). Oyster sauce – 3.12. Green onion – 1. For a total of: 27.38 (plus sales taxes, of course).
So the difference isn’t that big price-wise, especially if buy own store brand products.",0
6000,"it's kinda offensive to my weeb nature, but the best instant (packet) noodle brands (for me) are both Korean. Nongshim and Samyang are on a level man. Nongshim for the standard shin ramyun and Samyang for just about everything else.

6004,You are a cheap hack who has relied O  the staff you refuse to pay. I can't wait to watch you shit the bed. Hack ass dude.,0
6005,I’m not Korean but have experience in making many Korean dishes and taking my time researching them. For Japchee my understanding is while it’s true you’ll get a cleaner taste sautéing/stir frying the ingredients separately the *main* reason historically you prepare them separately is because the dish was often prepared for large groups.  Koreans usually do not use a wok so they really wouldn’t have a way to prepare a mass amount of servings for the typical cook.  For me the traditional way is unnecessarily slow and the ingredients become cold which is a problem if you want to eat it hot.  You don’t have that problem with a bigger mass of ingredients.  But even the great Maangchi has Japchee recipes where she basically one pots everything.  Also it’s probably one of the healthiest dishes on the list as the noodles as made with sweet potatoes.,0
6006,"Seems to me you don’t want to get the cheapest butter if you’re making a butter sauce (or pasta).  I mean if you’re using so few ingredients their taste is going to be more pronounced.

Also, as a Mexican American, I’m a bit surprised fideo was not in the list.  I suppose because it’s mostly served as a side dish.",0

Half a liter of stock or broth (from a cube, let's not kid ourselves here), 125g of soup noodles, leave on low heat until thick, stir in grated parmesan until dissolved, that's it. It's only one pot, doesn't need you to cut anything other than grade the parm, no spices necessary. Without this I would live of chocolate alone.",0

6100,"Okay, so after watching this video I was excited to try the top pick dish...the Budget Chili Garlic Noodles. I wanted to be certain to replicate the recipe exactly, so I went on Amazon and found the exact Buldak Ramen noodles that Josh used. Unfortunately, I had to buy 10 pkgs. in order to get them quickly...but I figured I would want to make it over and over so no big deal. Well, I made it today for lunch and I must say I'm very disappointed. And yes, I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor of the seasoning packs/sauces were oddly very sweet and off-putting....and there was waaay too much oil. There's no way 1/2 cup of oil is necessary,.... 1/4 cup would be more than enough for the amount of noodles. The dish was overly rich from all the oil and needed acid desperately, so I added lime juice to help balance it out. If this was the best dish out of all 8 they made, I sure won't waste my time trying the others.",0

Or even focus on a video where you have a couple ""larger"" ingredients that are used in a small portion for a given dish, but then produce multiple dishes that are easy and would use up the full amount of those ingredients.",0

6121,Not to mention that you can save a lot more by using sales and coupons.  Plus there's even more savings for dishes using chicken stock by making your own stock - because most chicken parts that come with bones and skin are a lot cheaper than the boneless/skinless versions and they provide you with bones and skins you can freeze until you have enough to make stock - combine with the trimmings of veggies you hopefully saved as well and you get something much better than the stock from a carton for pennies on the dollar.,1

I chose 2x spicy thinking ""well, 3x is gonna kill me probably"". 

I lasted about 5 bites. My mouth is on fire. My inner ears are on fire. I had to add plain yogurt to it to get that far. My husband wrapped his meal ""for the apocalypse"" 😅

It's cheaper!"" videos don't take into account that most people work 8 to 10 hours a day in pretty demanding jobs and cooking, even if it's for one is also a job. It takes 1 to 2 hours from start to finish(including cleaning) to do only 1 dish. That dish may cost only $10 when cooked at home, but even if I have to pay $20 for that same thing, I win much more in the rest and stress free evening(not having  all ingredients/tools exactly when you need them is stressful and annoying).",0

6549,"Some of the best cost saving tips are to get fish sauce, oyster sauce, spices and such in bulk, since you'll use them almost everywhere.
It's a bigger up front cost, but most of the dry spices and sauces have a stupid long shelf life, so unless you spill them there shouldn't really be much if any waste in the long run.
Save the whites+roots of your green onions as well, they'll legitimately grow for a while in your kitchen with just a glass of fresh water to sit in; if you plant them in a small pot with some medium you can easily turn a couple dozen green onions into a near unlimited supply (properly cared for, some of them grow an inch or more [25mm+] per day).",1

3. Pastina. The store chicken stock never has any taste. What do you buy? (My prime example is TJ's.)

5. SF Garlic Noodles, hmm. I will go look up Kenji's slower recipe. Thanks.

6. Yaki Udon  I like Udon. (Hint, find cheap brand of bonito flakes.) OK you are paying $5.21/oz and Amazon had it for $3.69 per oz if you buy an eighth, or #2.46 if you buy 2 bags of 2.82 oz.
    Maybe this video is old and the prices have fallen. FYI fellow internet strangers.

7  Japchae Korean.  Not as much sugar in this one. (What are those ""sweet potato noodles called? Say I go to the distant and really Asian store, H-Mart, where they dont live to talk to food-tourists. ... I need the real Korean or Chinese name for these noodles. 
     They are not shirataki, also called glass noodles- are they?  (""Shirataki noodles are a traditional Japanese noodle made from the konjac plant's corm. They are high in fiber, low in calories, and have a translucent, gelatinous appearance. The name ""shirataki"" is Japanese for ""white waterfall"" and describes the noodles' translucent appearance. Shirataki noodles are chewy, bouncy, and starchy, and they absorb flavors well. They can be used in place of pasta or rice in any dish, but they tend to work best in Asian recipes.""

6695,"I'd like to see a lowest cost dish with some kind of satiety index value.  The problem with these high sodium high carb yet cheap dishes is they are not very filling.  Most people will be very hungry shortly after wards and crave more food, making them spend more on food and get fatter which keeps a cycle going.  There's not a lot of fiber or protein, meat based protein in these dishes which are needed to release hunger hormones.  My hormone doctor explained this to me because I'm always fucking hungry, and I tried it, it's true.  You can test it yourself.  Try to eat a pound of pasta, it goes down so easy, like you don't even have to try.  Now try to eat half a pound of chicken breast, you'll about puke, it's hard to do.

I suppose these dishes are good if you only consider costs, but I'm looking for practicality where poor people can get a well balanced meal and feel full at the same time.  It reminds me of the conversations I've heard over the years where people will make comments, how are people on food stamps or whatever its called now so fat.  Well it's because they can only afford/buy the lowest quality things, like the cheap dishes in this video (which are really comfort dishes), which causes weight gain, increased hunger, low nutritional value, low satiety, etc.

I'd like to develop complete, healthy, inexpensive meals, well rounded meals that people could make or eat.",1

At the place I worked, we would add oil to pasta to keep them from sticking, you just dump the pasta in boiling water to reheat and drop it into a pan and add your sauce totally fine. A good way of maybe making a bunch of pasta at home and putting it in the fridge for the next few days without it clumping together. 

Also, some of you might say putting the oil pasta in water will get rid of all the oil. Trust me, there's a lot of oil on the pasta more than you would add in the water to keep it from sticking in the first place.",0

You should learn how to control for variable. Like uncle Roger said, too much is not good, this is because things behave differently based on what is being done and how much is being done. MSG for example is good for the brain, but too much of it kill your brain cell.

That's why in typical experiment we had control group where we do nothing to it. in this case adding an unsalted water to boil to compare to salted water to boil in various amount help to understand if there's any weird behavior in the experiment.

In this case, what if the two pot salter the usual and quadrupled amount boil faster than unsalted water but the one which you salted the most boiled later than the unsalted water? Surely the conclusion won't be salt had no effect but rather that there's a possibility that the last pot had too much salt that instead of increasing how fast the water boil might instead hinder it.

Then you repeat the experiment again to see if it is consistent to figure out if salt had no effect or if you add too much in the last pot.

Yes, experiment is expensive and time consuming and I didn't expect you to do that since this is cooking channel and not science channel and not everything science matter in cooking, but it just irks me a little bit how you dimiss a myth for no reason.

If you add salts into the water.
It will have higher boiling temperature and lower freezing point.
Regular water freezes at 0 C and boils at 100 C
If you put salt in it, it will boil at higher point depends on the salt molality, let's say 110 C and freezes at lower point, let's say -5 C.

This is the reason that if you put salt in water it will be harder to boil, it needs more energy, hence more time to reach the boiling point.

The amount of time it takes to make a pot of water boil is a silly thing to measure on its own because it relies on far too many variables.  The actual thing you want to measure is what temperature water boils at, and how does adding salt change it if at all.  The only thing adding salt will ever do is make the boiling point higher, which means it will take more time to boil any given amount of water if all other variables are the same. 

In practical terms though, you would have to add so much salt to have any appreciable effect that whatever you cook is likely to be inedible.  So just use salt as a seasoning when you're talking about boiling something.",0

7129,"Alright, so, lemme clear up some misconception on the whole bread in the fridge thing. 

If your goal is to keep your bread from going stale, dont put it in the fridge. The cold causes the starch in the bread to crystalize and lose moisture which makes it stale faster. 

Now if your sole goal is to prevent mold because you're not going to be using it for a while? Put it in the freezer. Freezing your bread will make it last far longer than refrigeration alone. 

As a side note, I've seen some of you in the comments here mention that fridging bread helps prevent mold because of the colder temps, which isnt 100% correct. As stated above freezing your bread helps slow the formation of mold because of the extreme temp despite the presence of moisture in the appliance. Yes, even though fridging your bread makes it stale faster because of the crystallization of the starches which causes them to lose water, the inside of your fridge itself still has more moisture in it than your cabinets or a bread box should, and moisture is what causes the mold to grow to begin with.

Therefore, just put your bread in your cupboard. Unless you've spilt water in there recently or something then a cool, dry cupboard is going to keep your bread from staling better than putting it in the fridge. Once it stales however? Toss it in the freezer if you're not regularly using it.",0
7130,"MSG is a naturally-occurring substance in its organic form, but when it’s extracted from a source and turned into an additive, it’s processed in some way. And while it’s impossible to totally avoid processed foods these days, we aim to limit them as much as possible. Add to this that MSG is found in many foods, so while it may be technically fine to consume in small to moderate doses, what happens when we eat it consistently all the time? It compounds in our systems. 

We’re also concerned by the limited research around MSG. The FDA may state it to be “generally safe,” but this gives us zero confidence that it’s truly okay to eat.

It brought back memories of instant boullion, flavored potato and tortilla chips, etc. Highly processed junk food in which MSG is frequently an ingredient.

Yeast extract contains naturally occurring glutamates. It too is used in highly processed junk food as a flavor enhancer. Still, I think the flavor is more subtle and pleasant than straight up MSG. 

I use very small amounts of Better Than Boullion in quite a bit of my cooking. Yeast extract is a key ingredient in BTB.

First of all, for an effect of intermolecular ligands, the sodium chlorine (or each other salt) will increase the boiling point of the war, but not in this quantity. Or at least, not in a ""normal"" quantity.
Second point, searing the meat is useful to make the meat ""losing"" some liquids to gain again while cooking, for a ""sort of"" equilibrium, thats why its important to sear while stewing. In general you tend to sear to have some maillard and some temperature difference in texture.

7219,"One thing to add about how many times you flip a steak: Flipping frequently will actually help prevent overcooking the inside if you're trying to get a thorough sear without letting the meat inside cook too much. That way you're limiting how long the steak is being heated from one side at a time. The thicker the steak the more this rule applies.

This is especially true if you cook sous vide before searing. You already have the desired doneness (or maybe a little less to let the searing process compensate), so if you leave the steak searing on one side for too long you're risking the heat permeating the meat from one direction for too long on and cooking it further. Flipping it frequently allows each side a chance to cool down a little before you flip back again.",0

However to get an actual time difference the concentration would have to be very high and that amount of salt is not worth the amount of time you can save. I think the highest amount in the video was above saturation and at first it used some energy (heat) to dissolve more of the salt into the water.  But don't quote me on that last bit",0

The reason people wash chicken in this part of the world is because we buy chicken from the wet market where they are sold just after they were slaughtered. Most of these chicken are not factory processed, precleaned or packaged, and they are exposed to dirt, blood, chicken feathers, etc. However if you buy those packed chicken from the supermarket, they are most likely cleaned at the slaughterhouse/factory, so washing them at home seems unnecessary. To make it short, we wash chicken not because of bacteria, it's more about the dirt that comes with it, like organs, feathers, etc. But somehow probably the habit gets carried over when Asians go to western country.",0

7438,"MSG itself isn't the culprit for bad health outcomes. We produce MSG in our livers ourselves. It helps us detect flavors that are normally below our taste threshold. This is actually a good thing as we are thus able to detect detrimental substances in our food as well. Ie, it was a survival feature, thus an evolutionary benefit to us.
However when we add MSG, especially in large or even excessive dosages, everything tastes a lot more intense. In some cases this just means we get used to this intense flavor and we crave MORE , AND MORE of it, causing us to overeat. The second negative effect is that we start to loose our ""natural"" flavor level as we get used to everything tasting beyond the natural flavors occuring. Thus we exceed our bodies' evolutionary limits of how much MSG it expects to find, thus masking flavors it would otherwise detect, such as if meat is off or spoiled only a little bit.
Both of these negatives are not part of the chemical formula, or its properties. It has to do with how we train our brain. That's the only way MSG is ""bad"" for you. Nothing more, but also nothing less.",0

What is the Anjinomoto Group- The Japanese Company that discovered MSG and the primary producer of MSG, AND THIS IS THEIR PRIMARY PRODUCT SO THEY GO TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE IT.

MSG IS NOT NATURAL.  It is a highly refined MANMADE CHEMICAL SOUP.  Oh, sure you find this NATURAL chemical in lots of food, but that is INFITESIMALLY SMALL AMOUNTS COMPARED TO COMMERCIAL MSG.  Remember those tests on Saccharin where they dumped massive amounts into the lab rats and it caused all kinds of problems?  YOU GET CLOSE TO THOSE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MAN MADE CHEMICALS WITH ANY MSG PRODUCT.  IT IS EXPONENTIALLY MORE POTENT THAN ANY NATURAL SOURCE.

99% OF ALL 'ALLEGED RESEARCH' THAT PROFESSES MSG IS SAFE, IS BASED ON THE ANJINOMOTO GROUP'S ORIGINAL RESEARCH done in the 1920's, then expanded every so often since them.  REAL DOCTORS POINT TO THE COMPANY'S BIASED RESULTS, MISSING DOUBLE BLIND, AND LACK OF OBJECTIVE MEDICAL TESTING. 

When you start looking at REAL MEDICAL TESTING- THIS STUFF DESTROYS BRAINS, LIVER, KIDNEYS EVEN STERILITY.  Research from India discovered children should NEVER eat MSG.  Research from REAL DOCTORS IN THE WEST points to the well known side effects of ingesting MSG: migraines, tachycardia, atrial fibrilation- A Fib, digestive distress, diarrhea, and even more more less well known side effects.  truthinlabeling dot org  search for recognizing adverse reactions.

Got to PUB MED, AND TYPE IN: PHYSICAL DAMAGE OF MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE- and you can see REAL DOCTORS DOING REAL RESEARCH AND THE EVIDENCE MEDICAL SCIENCE HAS OF HOW DANGEROUS THIS STUFF IS.  [Pub Med is the data base of articles and research abstracts collected by the National Institutes of Health; a government agency.

ALL OF EUROPE HAS BANNED MSG.  AUSTRALIA HASN'T BANNED IT, BUT IT IS ON THE 'RESTRICTED AMOUNTS IN EACH PRODUCT.'  THE USA FDA HAS DECIDED TO LAND ON THE FENCE: THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THIS CAN CAUSE SPECIFIC HEALTH PROBLEMS, BUT THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS SCREAMING FOR IT'S ACCEPTANCE... so the FDA said: they would not ban MSG until there was more medical evidence of it's toxicity.  Instead, they offered GRAS- generally accepted safe, but with caveats:  THEY RECOMMEND USING IS AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE, BUT SADLY, THEY DID NOT DEMAND IT BE LISTED AS A HEALTH THREAT LIKE ALLERGENS.

Some other marinating ingredients will soften aspects of the meat (vinegar/etc) and of course carbohydrates, salts, and various other chemicals can and will be carried inside the meat.  Salt has the most profound influence here which is why in most cases you can dry brine the meat and then glaze the meat with the rest of the marinade for nearly identical meats.

Also some meats like shellfish will actually hold marinade inside of them because the flesh has a level of porosity that land meats mostly lack.  Boiled eggs have this higher porosity as well.",0

7569,"Yah MGS is not bad for you.  Having more MSG in that handful of peanuts than you can find in 20 pounds of seaweed, might just upset your tum tums.    After all if its the ""king of flavor"" and ""perfectly safe"" yet produces addictive eating patterns in humans why not just roll the food in the stuff so they can sell 50% more.  Oh wait, this is exactly what Big Food does!  

Which is why I avoid MSG in any premade food.  It OD's me badly, and makes me sick every time, even when I had no idea it was in that particular food.   I find out AFTER finally being let free from my porcelain torment to go scrounge the package from the trash and boom, MSG.   Its why I had to stop eating Chick fil A, AND had to stop going to the soup shop around the corner that was amazing (I think they are using a MSG laced soup base.)  So maybe I'm racist as a white person for getting sick from white people food?  And yet all my corner Asian carry outs, all perfectly fine since they went no ADDED msg thanks to customer fears.  

I'll take my glutamates natural.  I can enjoy tomato's, seaweed, soy, and garlic, onions in any amount I can handle.   But one cube of knorr chicken bouillon, some BBQ chips, or a can of premade gravy later and I'm cramps and seated on the toiliet.   But if I DIY that gravy with chicken stock, kombu, mushroom powder, flour, spices, and garlic...oh I'm happy and my gut is happy too.  

So question, does not liking industrial food products made with complicated chemical extraction processes make me racist?  

Also, please pay no attention to the fact that commercial MSG is made from seaweed that is grown in offshore farms around some of the nations with worst pollution controls on the planet.  I mean what is wrong with farming offshore of a river delta when it runs pink in the summertime from the algae blooms thanks to industrial phosphor dumping.  Surely nothing is wrong there.   Remember mentioning that trace heavy metal contamination is -10,000 social credit score.   So is it the MSG, or the traces of dimethyl mercury in the MSG that makes me sick?  We'll never know, because ConAgra, Kraft, and Nestlé likes selling more product to make the stock go up, so they load their products with MSG, then fund the ""science"" to tell its more safe and wholesome than a puppy's hug.

In fact the more pressure I see to say MSG is completely safe, that nothing bad can ever happen, that everybody who has a bad experience is crazy, and that you MUST accept it, the more suspicious I get.  Why are they SO determined to MAKE me eat it?   These same people will tell you corn allergies exist, that Monsanto is giving everybody cancer,  then in the same breath tell you that you are worst human to ever live for not wanting to eat an artificial seasoning derived from industrial manufacturing.  Seems a little sus to me.  I'll put in some anchovy, or fish sauce,  on my food instead when it needs a flavor kick, thank you.

7589,"Jeez, I guess pulling pasta out of a pot and flinging it against the wall is easier than just popping it into your mouth to test it…

Anyone who’s bought a crap load of bread and frozen them knows, fridge or not, it’s about just the air, not temperature that is the bane of any bread.

Iron pan? It’s not the sponging and soap. It’s not even the soaping. It’s the scrubbing with abrasive surface.

Color? What color? For me, juices run clear, cooked. Run red, undercooked.

Aluminum Foil has different sides to them? Uh. Who knew. Or cared.

Yeah… I just use marinade for flavor and/or acid bath to break down tough cut of meat. It works. Leave a piece of meat in Coke and see what happens. Otherwise, yeah. Really no difference in toughness if not specifically for breaking down with acid. Brine does nothing but flavor.

Back to juice running red in chicken. Beef, juice run red good. Pork, eh… pink in meat good, juice probably not. Chicken, no. Basically, I think what it is, is that chicken and pork requires higher heat to kill unwanted microorganisms and that would break down the juices to run clear anyhow. Steak? Just run it through a warm room for me please.

Yes, no ice but ingredients do need to be either frozen or cold. Although he fucked up. Use small strawberries. The larger the berry is, the less flavorful and sweet it is. Also, best is recently picked ripen strawberries. Most supermarket fruits are like Menards 2x4, they’re both semi processed. One ripen, the other dried. 😉😉

MSG bad for you? Huh. Perhaps in the amount I see used in some recipes… I mean, they’re asking for two tablespoons of MSG in a pot of soup… seriously who the fuck uses two tablespoons of MSG in anything??? I grew up using MSG and have never in my life see anyone use even one tablespoon of MSG in ANY cooking. And yes, I double checked, it asked for tablespoons, not teaspoons.

Pasta… I think your sauce and cooking style matter more. Use all the fresh pasta you want, add store bought sauce, 🤢🤮

Ethylene-producing fruits, such as apples, bananas, peaches and honeydew melons, should not be stored next to avocados, lemons, grapes, onions and other fruits or vegetables that are sensitive to this compound. Also, you should never store ethylene-producing fruits together. ‘Uff said.

Fondle your meat all you want, just don’t squeeze the juice out of it. At least until you’re ready to…

As for salt in water, I think most recipes ask for it first just its flavor content as it’s only usually ask for when boiling pasta or rice BUT if you live in high altitude places, it is required as it increase the water boiling point to the point where it will cook dried food faster. At sea level… don’t do much for you.

Pervert. Sticking your thing inside the meatiest part of a chicken is asking to be arrested. If you are going to stick your thing inside the meatiest part of anything, asking any female of the human race is probably a better idea. But seriously, I wash my chicken and pick at it. Why? Because I buy thighs and legs for less than $0.49/lbs and when they’re that cheap, you need to do a little bit of plucking if you don’t want feathers quill with your baked chicken.

Sticky pasta? Just don’t leave hot wet pasta together to dry. Just like humans, hot and wet pasta will stick together into a messy blended bond that cannot be pulled apart.

Yeah… wrong test. The test should be sear one not the other, weighted, then throw into oven then see which one is lighter when done to same temperature. Oven uses heat to cook. Heat evaporates liquid. Pan style steak cook faster then even open fire cooking, which means sear or not loses liquid at slower rate.

Bigger pot? Look, it’s not the size, it’s how you use it. Apply both to cooking and personal antics…

As you stated, the myth was that bread goes stale FASTER in the fridge, but your test ""confirmed"" the opposite to be true (went stale slower), so your conclusion that the myth is true makes no sense. Also, generally speaking, your testing method isn't scientific. There are too many variables that are not accounted for and your observations are mostly subjective, not objective. Regarding marinating meat, you confirmed (sort of) that YOUR marinade does not improve tenderness, but that doesn't mean that ALL marinades fail to tenderize. A lot of fruits (pineapple, pear, papaya, etc,...) contain enzymes which break down proteins and connective tissues, so adding them to marinades will DEFINITELY tenderize meat.",0
7595,"There are several videos where they tested flipping frequency and movement in the pan.  The single flip normally results in the thickest (though not always nicest) crust but has more inconsistent cooking and a larger gray band.  Not moving the steak at all tends to result in an inconsistent crust.  The best results were flipping every 30 seconds ~ 1 minute and placing the steak onto a different part of the pan with each flip, giving a smaller gray band, nice even crust, and consistent cook.

The reason this works is that it keeps each side of the steak from getting too hot, gives a more balanced overall temperature, and the steak is placed on a hotter part of the pan with each flip which helps with the crust.

EDIT:  I would recommend Chris Young's video ""Why Flip Your Steak Every 30 seconds?"".  He was a chef at the Fat Duck and actually goes into the science of why.",7
7596,"That marinade would do nothing to tenderize it. Skirt traditionally uses citrus to break it down. Another natural tenderizer is pineapple.

The thing is the shiny side is alluminium on its metallic form (Al) where the matte side reacted with oxygen to create a thin layer of aluminum oxyde (Al2O3), that's the same concept as when you season a cast iron pan, create a thin layer of another material with different properties (non stick in this example). This reaction is called ""passivation"". This layer of aluminum oxyde is less reactive and will therefore not react with acidic cooking juices to create aluminum salts in your food.

About germs at the sink. We typically do this on market day: we prep meats (wash and marinate) and vegetables for the week or whatever, and then we clean the sink; in fact, most households do their meat prep outside at their 'outside sink' (typically a concrete sink in the washing area at the back of one's house).

7796,"Nooo the foil thing wasn't tested correctly. You lined cold pans... That isn't going to make a difference. 
The shiny side will keep foods hot for longer. Test with cooked meat (maybe 2 chicken breasts heated to the same internal temp), then cover each with foil (one shiny-side-down and the other the matte-side-down). The science theory is that the shiny side will reflect the heat back towards the meat, keeping it warm longer, while the matte side will let the heat dissipate faster.
Conversely, when you need to bake a casserole (such as lasagna which needs to be covered so it doesn't dry out) you would cover the food with foil shiny-side-down, so the heat of the oven isn't reflected away from the food. This could be tested with two smaller casseroles of the same size put side by side in the oven, one covered with foil shiny side up, one matte side up. After 20 minutes, take both out and check the internal temp and see which one got hotter faster. My guess is the matte-side-up gets hotter faster, shortening the total cooking time.",0

7818,"Chicken is fully cooked at 165F if, and only if, you somehow flash heat it to 165 for exactly 0 seconds and then cool it down to serving temperature.  Otherwise it's over cooked at 165F (in fact, 158F is the critical temperature for instant death of relavent pathogens).  A more reasonable temperature to target is 150F for a minimum of 2 minutes.  If you want to serve safe pink unbrined chicken, 145F for a minimum of 5 minutes is sufficient.

From my understanding, of international news, fast-food has been a factor in triggering and maintaining obesity in USA citizens as well as other nations thereafter. In addition, on this channel, Josh has ""But Better"" a KFC item ( I think) where he uses MSG in the mix. If I'm not mistaken, MSG was or still is used in fast-food items to enhance the flavour of said items. I'm no nerd or chemist or such however I did read and also heard a pharmacist talk about how MSG can mess up the thyroid which is where most of your hormones are managed. SO...if MSG can f up your main hormone management AND is used in fast-food industry (which supposedly made Americans obsessed, and other people, ofc) isn't it really plain obvious that MSG CAN be dangerous for you? Sure, not in your 1-2 meals a week but on a daily diet I think it can be damaging to some. Like...those who the news are talking about. I've talked to an ex classmate of mine who went to China a few years ago and they gained 20kg in 2 weeks (let's presume that's an exaggeration and it was more like 10 or 15). After they got back they said their favourite dish (cooked by their mom) had NO taste whatsoever. Ofc they also stated the food there tasted amazing. I think is safe to assume they were using a f tone of MSG in every dish and that person had eaten, daily, perhaps unknowingly, MSG-spiced food. So is MSG truly not bad for you? For some, sure, for others, not so much. Use with caution and moderation. Food ain't supposed to kill you, remember? Food is supposed to keep you alive and well.",0

In reality its better to just cut into your steak fast asf when its on your plate to keep all your juices. Another issue with resting is that the meat will continue to cook unless you cut it and let the hot steam out.

THIS IS CHEMICALLY IMPOSSIBLE 
There’s this thing 
Called freezing point depression and boiling point elevation that exists when you add a salt to water 
Essentially based on the number of moles of salt in the water relative to its volume the temperature at which said water will freeze/boil changes 
In this case 
If you add NaCl (table salt) to water it WILL LITERALLY MAKE IT TAKE LONGER
However this is not a reason to not salt pasta water as it will make the pasta cook quicker 
Why? Well…. Allow me to indulge myself 
Because of equilibrium and how that stuff works 
When a liquid is boiling, it tends to stop accepting more heat energy 
Because well, that heat is what is kicking those other molecules out to become vapor 
This matters because when you heat up water to its normal boiling point, you can’t really heat it up past that. However if it has a higher boiling point then the water is literally hotter than it would be w/out the salt. This matters because it makes pasta cook faster

Look at page 35 of that report and you will very clearly see that if you cook chicken even to 145F it will be safe as long as it's at that temperature for at least 4 minutes.  The texture will be very soft and slimy, but it will be just as safe as a higher temp.  If you cook to 155F it only has to be there for 23 seconds for a 7-log sub 10 lethality of harmful bacteria.

8225,"Adding salt to water will actually increase the time it takes water to boil, if you control for every other variable that influences energy input.  The effect is fairly slight: half a degree (celsius) per 58 grams of salt per kilogram (that's per litre of water) - for the Americans, that is very roughly 1 degree fahrenheit per 2 ounces of salt dissolved in a pint of water.  (That's all rough in-my-head conversions, run the math if you want precision).  Point being, this is more something that matters if you're doing something that requires cooking with ocean water, or possibly specifically water from the Great Salt Lake or the Dead Sea.

This happens for fairly detailed chemistry reasons, but basically the water molecules have a slight electrostatic pull to the sodium and chloride ions in the salt, and just having more stuff in the solution makes it take more energy to change state.  This effect also applies to freezing water, which is why you can see ice forming in lakes but not the ocean sometimes.",0

8317,PAPA (that’s what my mom also calls me) for #13 the salt isn’t to make it boil faster it’s for it to make the boiling point of the water go up thereby cooling the food faster. So in chemistry pure water boils at 99.something C but with impurities it can reach 100C so when you introduce salt that has a boiling point of about 1000something C it raises the boiling point of water all so slightly and that slight increase also raises the temp the water gets to as thereby cooks the food faster. Think about how pressure cookers work and cook food in a fraction of the time just by increasing the boiling point of water from 99somethinfg to ~120C ❤ kisses,0

It changes the boiling point of water by de-stabilizing the intermolecular forces that bind water into a liquid, making it easier for heat to break them, thus making it become a vapor. However, adding too much salt will have the opposite effect, because you are increasing the mass of the solution, requiring more heat to increase it's temperature.",0

8465,"To the Marinade Myth:

This is misinformation. The reason a marinade tenderizes beef is that people usually include ingredients that contain enzymes and/or acids that break down the meat (like pineapple, tomato, etc..) These enzymes and acids break down the meat so that the fibers are less held together, thus tenderness. In your case however, the meat soaked in the acid for too long causing it to actually tighten up after it had already loosened. That’s why we marinate things over night, not for 24 hours. Also this isn’t even a myth in the first place it’s well known information. As a matter of fact, should you leave meat in pineapple for too long it will become so tender that it basically just disintegrates and is unworkable. 

And also also, the marinade you used doesn’t include any enzymes like those from pineapple so it’s gonna be a lot less tender compared to a marinade with said enzymes.

A light re-season after chlorine is advisable. 
I prefer a light season on my pan because it gives a better sear. This is because seasoning like enamel or Teflon act as a thermal insulator. Having exposed iron means better thermal conductivity but you have to heat the pan after use and leave oily.

It was true decades ago when soap had lye in it. The lye in the soap would strip off the seasoning. 

But more modern soaps like Dawn dont have lye, and thus dont strip the seasoning off the cast iron. 

The two most important things when cleaning cast iron after using soap: 
1- dont let it soap. Just clean the pan
2- since it was wet, once its dry, you need to heat it on the stove and apply a thin layer of oil to the cooking surface and mostly wipe it off. This helps the cooking surface continue to build seasoning since, other than preventing rust, when you next preheat the pan it will season the little bit of leftover oil.",8

In relation to the cast iron pan myth when you are seasoning a cast iron pan you are polymerizing the carbon bonds in the chains of hydrocarbons in the oil, as these strong polymers form the lock themselves onto the pores of the metal as they become long and complex, therefore, unless your soap is an actual solvent (its definately not) it will not damage yhe seasoning. finally water with salt in (known as brine in chem) will actually boil slower (marginally) because the boiling point of saturated brine (meaning there is as much salt as will disolve in the qater) is 109°c which is 9°c higher than pure water",1

8773,"About MSG:
Glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter, meaning that it can cause irritation and, consequently, many adverse effects, including dyspnea and explosive diarrhea. It is not for everybody. 
Glutamate is really an amino acid that is present in proteins; however, in food, it is in covalent bond with other amino acids. Therefore, it does not activate the many nerve endings in the esophag and stomach. Think about starch and sugar: starch is made of many sugar molecules that are covalently bound, and it cannot activate the ""sweet tastebuds"". When starch is broken down to sugar molecules before consumption, it becomes sweet.
So, using MSG is not bad on its own, but if someone cooks for others, they shall always be transparent about it.",1

2) the material is so thin that the idea that there are two sides with different properties is almost laughable. 
3) heat transfer isn't about how much light is reflected otherwise you could cook food with a normal light bulb faster than an oven. Heat transfer is to do with the contact surface sizes

8804,"The matt/shiny side of aluminium foil isn't a myth but was tested wrong.
What happened here is the oil went down and heat comming from the top fried the potatoes. If he would also cover the top it would show a big diference.

You can test it easily by completely wrapping two raw potatoes, one matt side in, the other shiny side in, and baking them for 30-60 minutes.
The one that has the shiny side on the inside will be baked beautifully.

Anothe way of proving this is heat protection. If You get, for example, a hot sandwitch wrapped in foil, if the shiny side if facing outside You will feel the heat of the sandwitch.
However, if the matt side is facing out, the heat from the food will be much lower.

Besically it works like this: heat if being transfered in the direction from the matt side to the shiny side but blocked when going from the shiny side to the matt side.

In this test he left a huge gap, by not covering the top, for the heat to go as it pleases so there was no major difference.",0

MSG can’t be generalized for the public, some people have some sort of sensitivity from MSG and some others don’t!👥
Usually people who suffer from migraines are advised not to consume MSG as those are considered as sensitive individuals.🙅🙇
Also people with high blood pressure and high sodium consumption are advised not to consume it too!🧂(the name already says monoSODIUM glutamate)🤔

Is it okay to consume?🧐 No one can answer that, it is not a poison so we could say “No”.🧪
 If you’re worried about it then it is advised to ask a nutritionist. If you can’t, if you have any of the conditions said upward, you’re highly advised to stop consuming it.🫀

Also about “Uncle Roger”’s reply… you really can’t say “It is okay to consume” as it is hard to know if you’re a sensitive individual or not.☹️

Also alcohol is NOT an amazing thing by any means! It is always better not to consume it at all!😰

8991,"I teach high school chemistry and can help with the water boiling myth.  If you add salt to water, it actually raises the boiling point of the water.  Obviously, a small amount won't change it by much.  But this is what's called one of the colligative properties of solutions (properties depending on the molarity aka concentration of solutions rather than the identity of the solute).  Non-volatile solutes raise boiling points of solvents.  They also lower freezing points.  When you have the salt molecules in the water, the salt (after breaking into sodium ions and chloride ions) is taking up space in the water, acting as barriers for the water to switch from liquid to gas.  It's sort of like trying to get through a crowd.  If you are water molecules trying to get the speed necessary to turn into a gas, you're going to be slowed down by the solute that is now in your space.  Keep in mind that sodium chloride isn't going to boil at the temperature water boils (it isn't even going to melt but it did break into its ions).  So, to become a gas, the water has to go faster than it normally would need to go.  This means the burner must add more energy to the pot.  Because the temperature needs to go up (temperature is just a measurement of the average kinetic energy of the molecules).  In the video, not enough salt was added to really affect it, but it most certainly will not boil faster.",0
8992,"The no soap in cast iron was true 40-50 years ago. 
Bad substance was removed.",0
8993,"#13 is just poor wording - it increases the boiling point of the water, so it'll reach the boiling temp slower, but it'll impart more energy into the food so your food should cook a little quicker. It'll also allow you to keep it at 100C without as much activity in the pan.

The amount of salt is going to mean the difference is hardly anything though, really it just allows some salt to be easily absorbed into the food while cooking (since it's absorbing salty water), that's why adding salt to boiling water is good, nothing else.

if you want water to boil quicker, either add more heat or launch it into space.",0
8994,"The crap ton of salt you poured into the one pot actually insolated the water from the heat. You should have dissolved all the salt first.

9117,"On topic of overhandling - If suficiently heated, it will crust, end of a conversation. But there are some things to consider. Flipping several times help distribute heat more evenly and faster, because it heats more surface area of meat, which can be good when cooking chicken breasts. But meat also shrinks and deforms as it cooked, so it's best to get as much sear as you can, before it starts curl up and you are no longer able to have full contact with pan, so best sear you can get is when you lay down the meat on pan, therefore not touching it while does its thing is prefered.",2

Pizza only existed with pre-bought, garbage jars of bolognese spread over boxed pizza dough mix, laid so thick you could brain someone with the ""cooked"" dough; so pale it'd blind you.

Honestly rather than stick to tradition or only one source of anything, look around. Test stuff out. Multiple times. Make mistakes, learn and change stuff a bit at a time.

Adding salt to water actually increases the boiling point of water due to the colligative property of solutions that states that adding a solute to a solvent decreases its vapor pressure.

9412,"Funnily enough, on the subject of steak and juice, there was a guy not too long ago on YT here who scientifically proved that resting steaks actually does nothing at all in regards to juiciness. He did it, simply, by using a special stovetop with near perfect temperature control, and by weighing steaks he cooked there to see how much moisture they were losing when they were cut. For the resting steak he also measured how much it lost to evaporation from the actual rest.

The result was, interestingly, that the amount of juice that left the steak when it got cut was more or less exactly the same for both steaks. The only reason a steak that hasn't rested appears to be losing so much juice is because that juice is only the juice that was on the surface of the steak and got seared away; meaning if you let it rest that same juice just evaporates anyways and never hits your mouth. He used an interesting analogy with syringes to explain why juice leaves steaks when they get cut at all, and it has everything to do with the internal temperature- the higher the temp, the higher the vapor pressure of the water inside the steak. Meaning that unless you're eating cold meat, your steak is always going to lose more or less the same amount of juice due to cutting since you're presumably always eating it at the same rough temperature.",80

9443,"Before I finish watching, I'm going to post anyways and potentially look foolish if it's already discussed. The reason the saying ""soap removes cast iron seasoning"" exists is because it came about before dish detergents were a thing.

In the case of smoothies, ice does create that annoying froth because the ice crystals can shatter and re-form during the blend, or cause parts of the fruit to freeze during blend, etc. A better way to dilute smoothie in a blender without needing ice is to use either straight fruit juice, or milk/cream depending on the kind of smoothie you're making.",7

I've seen enough videos of Guga doing exactly these kinds of experiments, and learning through trial and error that acidic marinades will make the meat fall apart even before it gets cooked- such that once it is cooked it melts in the mouth. For the purposes of this video, it's likely either that your marinade wasn't acidic enough, it didn't marinade for long enough, or something about the cut of meat just really did not properly absorb the acid.",11

Please repent and turn to him before it is too late. Accept Jesus into your heart and invite him to be Lord and saviour of your life and confess and believe that Jesus is Lord, that he died for your sins on the cross and that God raised him from the dead. Confess that you are a sinner in need of God's Grace and ask God to forgive you for all your sins through Jesus.
Jesus loves you. Nothing can compare to how he loves you. When he hung on that cross, he thought of you. As they tore open his back, he thought of your prayer time with him. As the thorns dug into his head, he thought of you spending time in the word of God. As the spears went into his side, he imagined embracing you in heaven.",2

Still, when choosing to cook a Chinese meal, I would never willingly do the egg rolls (I prefer the Vietnamese spring rolls with their sauce, to be honest, and even that is far from my favourite meal; summer rolls, on the other hand... yum!) or a noodle dish, and fried rice is probably the worst of them all. Pot stickers, that is something I do quite regularly, they are absolutely awesome. Beef broccoli, sure, sometimes, although I prefer the version where you marinate the beef with tons of ginger and then stir fry with some green vegetables - it doesn't have to be broccoli, snap peas, or green beans work perfectly well. And then, of course, mapo tofu, braised pork belly, hot and sour soup, or chicken corn egg drop soup.",0
9666,I would destroy everything on that table,0
9667,Is that pork Halal?,0
9668,Why the MSG?,0
9669,Looks good. But would Uncle Roger approve?,0
9670,"I never get beef n brocoli. But when ever i eat it, i aint mad neither. Velvet beef is delicious. But its all about the sweet and tangy deep fried proteins! Such as general taos or orange chicken. And the number one dish is sweet chinese spare ribs, or honey walnut shrimp. 

I love lomein and mist takeouts does it well. Its about texture of the noodles, however it varies from place to place.

Fried rice is usually never exciting at takeouts, besides i like plain white rice better when pairing with all the sweet n tangy options.

I dont like chinese egg rolls neither, never had an enjoyable experience in my life, i think because im southeast asian and prefer south east asian eggrolls - which btw is the actually cuisine that uses fish sauce base dipping sauce not usually whats paired with chinese takeout as rhey usually pair it with red sweet and sour sauce.",0
9671,You're basically Chinese now?,0
9672,"With potstickers you’re supposed to add corn starch to the water so it makes a crust at the bottom… I would argue that the Chinese still do this one better than you Josh lol. Not saying yours didn’t look good, I still 100% would 😅😅",0
9673,This chef!!! All the cooking techniques and actually recipes love it all,5
9674,"One of the things about making food at home that is so underrated is that you get to pick what goes in the dish, yes at places like chipotle you get to pick what goes in but you dont get to pick what kind of grade or freshness its at. At home you have full control of the quality of the ingredients",0
9675,When is Part 2 coming ?,0
9676,"try some traditional and popular dishes from Romania (Sarmale, mici, papanași and perișoare soup🎉❤",0

9684,Huge fan ! I have a small Austin based podcast and always wanted you on as a guest !?,0
9685,I always skip the lomein. My go-to noodle dish at a Chinese buffet is the glass noodle stir-fry. Love that texture.,0
9686,Go ahead and make that Mongolian Beef!! I like mine with a lot of sauce and light onions and extra beef 😂😂😂 also make some pork wonton!,0
9687,Tf is this pop sound for every caption.,0
9688,"never cook lo mein again, that was horrifying to watch",0
9689,I'm sorry....potstickers?,0
9690,"the fried rice is close, but you are supposed to pour your sauce on the hot wok, not into the rice, so it caramelizes a bit on the way down the wok.",1
9691,Not surprised if uncle Roger make a video react to this,0
9692,Orange chicken or Sesame chicken all day over Tso’s,0
9693,"He REALLY needs to get other people to judge the food, because they’re both so biased.",0
9694,Uncle Rodger is watching! Funny,0
9695,"I will say for the record I am Cantonese Chinese, the closest style of cuisine to American takeout, and we don’t make anything this way (don’t have egg rolls but rather spring rolls, don’t use green onion in dumplings, and many more)… however I appreciate this video as an American Takeout demo and it’s interesting to see how migrants have brought something over and have it grow into something else!",0

9703,it come wih egg woh,0

9705,Your lo mein is actually chow mein isn't it???,0
9706,Made the beef & broccoli tonight…WOW!! Family devoured it!! Thanks Papa!! 🥰,0
9707,"my advice : 1.about noodle sauce : replace half soy sauce by salt,  2. when you saute the noodle, you should put sliced ginger and garlic on the oil at first until they have become golden to release it's flavor, 3. adding minced green onion when finished the process, fried green onion can smell stink . 4. potstickers, add some flour (20%-) in water and you'll get a super crispy butt ! 5. I'm a chinese.",0
9708,Are all these recipes in your book?,0
9709,Me sitting here 😭😭 because my brand new wok is useless having a electric stove. 😭😭,0
9710,"I'm an asian, not particularly fond of American Chinese takeouts due to high content of MSG but I came to watch the talent of the chef Joshua. Being impressed is an understatement.",0
9711,"I agree, I’d put crab rangoons in there. Put a little soy inside, omg best meal ever lol",0
9712,What is GBD?,0
9713,I'm assuming I can just leave out the celery and it will taste just as good (as I am violently allergic).,0
9714,I'm gonna need to see Uncle Roger's take on the fried rice,1

9719,I have a suggestion for a video. You could cook all European national dishes and rank them just like you did with the US states' dishes,0
9720,"No no no no on the frozen peas in rice. That texture is so off. It is not Chinese take out if you do not have pea pods in the kitchen.

Do not measure broccoli by the head. There is no consistency in size there. A head can be as small as a fist or as large as a football.",0
9721,Looks great.  Do you deliver?  To the arse-end of Norway?  🤣,0

9726,why the Indian kid glazing so damn much,0
9727,"Make whatever food you want pls just leave China out of it.
ok the dumplings are decent",0
9728,Celery on Lo-Mein should be a criminal offense,0
9729,"all this food looks amazing, but jesus, you have no idea how much a table spoon actually is. thats more like a half a CUP of oil per use",0
9730,Where's the Egg Foo Yung?,0
9731,Nice video 🥰 thank you for sharing,0
9732,"first, those aren't egg rolls, those are just spring rolls. Not to mention, they should NOT look so blistered, they should have a smooth GBD instead of triggering everyone with trypophobia. 

Second, the potsticker sauce is not that complicated, it is literally worcester sauce. In shanghai its called “辣酱油” or ""spicy soy sauce"" and it was introduced from Shanghai being colonized by Europe. Also, most potsticker filling is purely meat, very rarely do you see veggies and it definitely isn't cabbage.

Don't even get me started on lo mein. Everything down to the name of this dish screams ""cultural appropriation"". I mean, americans didn't even bother to spell the pronunciation correctly.

Fried rice: under no circumstance should chinese fried rice EVER contain mirin. Also, chinese fried rice doesn't have garlic

Beef and broccoli??? are you kidding me? calling beef and broccoli chinese is an insult to china

General Tso's chicken is an even bigger insult. Once again, I blame America for just pulling ideas out of its ass an calling it chinese. I'm a chinese person living in china my entire life and guess what? this dish doesn't exist in china",0
9733,"Now make ASIAN takeout and do some swapa swapa to include Japanese meal. General Tso is easily replaced by some nice karaage.
Lo Mein is beaten to a pulp by Yakisoba!",0
9734,Why are you adding mirin (japanese rice wine) to Chinese dish?,0
9735,"as a chinese person, i can ssafely say that none of these dishes are actually chinese",0

9866,"""I LOVE LO MEIN"" Then right after ""I like lo Mein but i don't love lo mein"" Are you ok josh?",0
9867,I would love to know what the differences are in White Pepper vs Black Pepper.,0
9868,"I can understand orange chicken losing because depending on where you had it, it is very different. If you get it from Panda Express, it is sweet and spicy. If you get it from a lot of more traditional Chinese places, it is very bitter and sharp.",0
9869,Meanwhile chinese people still looking for the chinese dishes of this video 😅😬,0
9870,Have you ever seen Chinese eating in Chinese takeaway?,0

9875,First time I’ve ever heard you recommend store bought anything with the egg roll wrap,0
9876,Mix them all in to one bowl and you're winning.,0
9877,Chinese takeout food is one of the things that is never worth making yourself especially if you want a large variety. You will spend way too much money on ingredients you most likely wont use again or rarely and it will take way too much time if you wanna make 6 or 7 things you would typically get with traditional Chinese takeout.,0
9878,Missing Ginger Beef!!!!,0
9879,we need your recipe for crab rangoons!!,0
9880,"I want to try ALL these recipes but I have a question: is the MSG really, really necessary?  I’m pretty sensitive to it and would prefer not using it.",0

9885,"Egg rolls are probably my favorite food ever and I've been making them at home for many years. One time, I made homemade egg rolls at a house party, people were drinking and partying hard, I put the egg rolls out, a pyramid of them stacked on a plate , one person tried one and word of mouth spread fast, they were gone very quickly and I got lots of compliments and questions about it. No lie, homemade egg rolls are not comparable to any other egg roll from a restaurant or frozen food isle. It gets so much better. Personally I go heavier on the veggie ratio and use nice little bite cubes of fresh ginger, black pepper, garlic, green onion, mushroom, those flavors play off eachother.",2
9886,"imo the best Chinese or Asian food takeouts, hands down, are those bento boxes prepared by Asian moms and grandmas",0
9887,Sweet chili sauce? How dare you. Nuoc mam is the obvious choice for dipping. Will also accept Mam nem as a sub if so desired.,0
9888,Where crab rangoon??????,1
9889,eating rice with fork!!! 🤭,0
9890,"The two things I would change would be to sub the beef and broccoli for Mongolian beef, and sub the Lo Mein with Mei Fun (I LOOOOOOOVE Mei Fun). Other than that, I can get down on this setup. I'm also greedy and would probably also add some egg drop soup (one of my favorite things to make, I actually will probably make it as soon as I'm done typing this comment), just to give me a more liquidy texture disruptor (and also because I'm a glutton for eggs).",0
9891,"Josh, its 2024 use timestamps",0
9892,"I'm sure all those are good but it's interesting that none of them are dishes that would have gotten my vote. I'm generally of the opinion that the American-style dishes are boring (for me). Your mileage may vary, of course, as it's okay for us all to have different preferences.",0

9903,"No, the best Chinese food in the world is cooked by the Chinese people that run my favorite sushi place. Eventually, no matter where I am in the world, I eat so much sushi out any particular sushi joint that my favorite restaurant invites me to try the food they are cooking for themselves. I've had meals that are normally illegal to serve to customers in the United States. Always awesome, always authentic.",0

9930,why are egg rolls called egg rolls?,0
9931,I'd love the fried rice you made.  By the way I am Chinese,0
9932,"My friend, this is important. As a dumpling savant, I have scoured the world for good dumplings. The very best in my local metro are Gu's Dumplings in Atlanta. They have this amazing, renowned, secret sauce that has very unique essences I haven't been able to replicate. I think it has plum in it. If you're ever in the area, stop by there and enjoy. I'd love to see what you think and if you could recreate.",0
9933,Hope nobody gets arrested for enjoying this succulent Chinese meal.,0

10003,Duck sauce and Chinese mustard goes with rolls!!,0
10004,"gosh I cant wait till I live on my own and can just buy the food for myself and cook for myself so I can, for example, make an eggroll without carrots or cabbage. 
Im sorry I just dont like the texture. 
Also why are there no eggs in an eggroll? Imagine its an ingredient on the outside but you dont call a cake an egg cylinder. I wanna add eggs. Maybe pork.
As another example though I usually can order it like this - fried rice with no carrots and no peas.",0
10005,"Just from looking at the thumbnail, without watching one second of your video, when I saw the title that ""you made the best Chinese takeout meal ever"", I thought ""Dude, I believe you!"". Looks great!",0
10006,who told you eggroll is served with a sweet chili sauce?,0
10007,"If I've never been to a Chinese place before, I'll usually get their beef and broccoli. I find it's a really good benchmark to judge the rest of their dishes by. If they fuck up beef and broccoli, there's a really good chance the other things on the menu are going to be worse.",0
10008,I think Aussies might add a pork or seafood dish.,0

10038,Andrew you have become my favorite chef and yeah I ordered your book.,0
10039,This looks so good mate. but add the egg AFTER adding the rice. Then use a soup ladel to ''punch'' the rice as you cook the rice and egg. This ensure that each grain of rice has a lovely encasing of egg throughout. Tho you might find it best to remove the other ingrediants as you do this :) Try it :D,0

We hope that you are a free thinking, broadminded, and prejudice-free human being whose goal is to find the truth.

SOME FACTS



Islam has approximately 1 billion followers known as Muslims who follow the final revelation to mankind, known as the ""Qur'an"", revealed to Prophet Muhammad about 1400 years ago. Contrary to the common misconception, only about 20% of all Muslims are Arabs, the rest are Indians, Indonesians, Bosnians,Africans,Chinese,turkish and so on
.


WHAT IS ISLAM



Islam, unlike most other religions, is not named after any man. Instead Islam means the submission of one's will to the only true god worthy of worship ""Allah"" and anyone who does so is termed a ""Muslim"". The word also implies ""peace"" which is the natural consequence of total submission to the will of Allah. Islam is the religion that was given to Adam, the first man and the first prophet of Allah, and it was the religion of all the prophets sent by Allah to mankind like Jesus and Moses
.


THE MESSAGE OF ISLAM



The most important message of Islam is the absolute Unity of God-that there is only One Supreme Being who has no partners and is not dependent on anyone or anything. He is the creator of everything and the whole universe is under His control. Since the total submission of one's will to Allah represents the essence of worship, Islam is the worship of Allah alone and the avoidance of worship directed to any person, place or thing other than Allah. In essence, Islam calls man away from the worship of creation and invites him to worship only its Creator. Allah is the only one deserving man's worship as it is only by His will that prayers are answered. Hence prayers to the non-living such as the sun, fire, and to humans whether they be Jesus, Moses or even Muhammad are rejected, as Allah informs us in the opening chapter of the Qur'an, known as Soorah Al-Faatihah, verse 4:

""You alone do we worship and from you alone do we seek help.""

A Muslim believes that Allah and His creation are distinctly different
entities. Neither is Allah His creation or a part of it, nor is His creation Him or a part of Him. Ultimately, it is the belief that the essence of Allah is everywhere in His creation or that His divine being is or was present in some aspects of His creation, which has provided justification for the worship of creation. Islam, hence, is a clear call to the worship of the Creator and the rejection of creation-worship in any form.



THE MIRACLE OF QUR'AN



""And if you are in doubt as to what We [Allah] have revealed…then produce a Soorah (chapter) like thereunto""(Soorah Baqarah 2:23)
This was the challenge put forth by Allah in the Qur'an 1400 years ago. As of yet, none has or will ever come close to meeting this challenge. Hence, as a result, multitudes throughout the centuries have believed and continue to believe in the Qur'an as a revelation beyond any human capacity. Modern scientists, for instance, have been amazed by the accuracy of scientific information presented in the Qur'an. Here are just a few examples:

In his book of embryology-'The Developing Human' [W.B. Saunders Publishing, 1982], Dr. Keith Moore added a whole chapter to discuss the scientific accuracy of the Quranic discussion of this science. Another eminent scientist, Dr. Maurice Bucaille wrote in his book-'The Bible, the Qur'an and Science':

""I could not find a single error in the Qur'an…if a man was the author of the Qur'an how could he have written facts in the 7th century A.D. that today are shown to be in keeping with modern scientific knowledge""
Facts about astronomy, the animal world and other natural phenomenon, that were alien to modern science not long ago, are scattered among the messages of Allah's Unity and His Attributes throughout the miracle that is known as al-Qur'an
.


WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER RELIGIONS



There are so many sects, cults, religions, philosophies, and movements in the world, all of which claim to be the right way or the only true path to Allah. How can one determine which one is correct or if, in fact, all are correct? The method by which the answer can be found is to clear away the superficial differences in the teachings of the various religions, and identify the central object of worship to which they call, directly or indirectly. False religions all have in common one basic concept concerning Allah: they either claim that all human beings are gods or that specific individuals were Allah or that nature is Allah or that Allah is a figment of man's imagination. For example, Prophet Jesus invited his followers to worship Allah but those who claim to be his followers today call people to worship Jesus, claiming that he was Allah while Jesus himself would deny this as Allah says in the Qur'an:

""And behold Allah will say: ""O Jesus the son of Mary Did you say to men, Worship me and my mother as gods besides Allah; He [Jesus] will say-""Glory to You I could never say what I had no right (to say')"" (Soorah Al-Maa'idah- 5:116)

Even though false religions might teach some good things, they all, however, teach the greatest evil- the worship of creation. Creation-worship is the greatest sin that man can commit because it contradicts the very purpose of his creation, which is the worship of Allah as explained in the following verses:

""Verily Allah will not forgive the joining of partners with Him, but He may forgive (sins) less than that for whom so ever He wishes"" (Soorah An- Nisaa 4:48 and 116)
""I have only created Jinns and men, that they may worship me"" (Soorah Zaareeyaat 51:56)



WHY SHOULD I BE A MUSLIM


Since the consequences of false religion are so grave, the true religion of Allah must be universally understandable and attainable, not confined to any people, place or time. Within the central principle of Islam and in its definition, lies the roots of lslam's universality. Whenever man comes to the realization that Allah is one and distinct from His creation, and submits himself to Allah, he becomes a Muslim and is eligible for paradise. This is the essence and the corner-stone of Islam:
""Laa Elaaha lllallaah"" (There is no god worthy of worship except Allah)

Its repetition and the sincere belief in it automatically brings one within the fold of Islam and guarantees one Paradise. Thus, the final prophet of Islam is reported to have said, ""Any one who says: there is no god but Allah and dies holding that (belief) will enter paradise."" (Reported by Abu Dharr and collected by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim",0

At this point I've probably made it over 100 different ways and there's one aspect I can't replicate and that's the texture. It's fine the day of but maybe I'm weird but I really like general tso leftovers the next day and every recipe I've tried, the breading gets soggy the next day when reheated. Not just soggy but mushy to the point that it's basically falling off whereas the takeout version becomes very chewy and seems like it's spot welded to the chicken and you couldn't separate it if you tried. Maybe that's because I have a glass top electric range and I don't own a flat bottom wok and I'm not cooking it hard enough in the sauce. It's the only variable I haven't been able to change.",1

10387,"I do enjoy this channel, but I have to say, i will never make any of your recipes. You always have things like Xaioxing (probably spelled that wrong) wine, or Korean Chilies, or Black Vinegar that are not readily available, and that aren't used regularly (at least, here in the US). I'm not a great cook, and I don't want to have a bottle of wine sitting in my cupboard waiting for me to make one specific recipe. It's great that there's content out there for people who want to elevate their cooking, but the more I see your content, the more I realize that it is not intended for beginner cooks, nor is it intended for everyday use. It's what you make for special occasions, or when you want to show off. You wouldn't make most of this every day. Which is especially amusing, as my understanding of stuff like Fried Rice is that it was originally a ""throw whatever is in the fridge into the pot with some rice and fry it all up"" recipe! Also, let me just use my Wok that I totally have on a traditional electric burner. That will work really well!",2

I could never really afford to travel to different places but just trying all this different food made by people from all those different places, it really opened my mind to different flavours! 
Also, if you like to cook, you can try to make those dishes yourself but even better, you can choose what you like best from each of these dishes and make your own meal. Some people might feel offended if you change one of their typical meals by mixing in ingredients from a completely different country but I think that, as long as you're not claiming that you're ""improving"" a traditional meal but you're creating your own, inspired by different cultures and traditions, you're doing nothing wrong.",29

I prefer sliced, velveted chicken to ground chicken too. Honorable mention to the sides of rice that have chicken fat cooked in them, hunan beef, and moo goo gai pan!",1
