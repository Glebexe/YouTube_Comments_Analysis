4,"Tried out Suna and Udio with my own lyrics in Latvian language. 
Suno generates full songs but the voice is not distinct, it's raspy and as if mixed from different choir voices. Udio voices have much more distinct characteristics and often sound like a mix of identities and styles of popular Latvian singers. But sometimes Udio sings total rubbish or mangles the lyrics in weird way. When Udio sings proper words, it sounds very believable and emotional.
I wish there was a tool that could expand on my own supplied melody though providing me with more detailed control over arrangement using simple descriptive commands like ""make it more tense here"", ""make it less naive here"", ""use a countermelody I will whistle now"" etc.",0

17,"Interesting topic (to me, anyway). A few observations that I've made in dealing with A.I.:

1. A.I. requires data (Large Language Models, for example, are just glorified cut and paste machines). We create data (as well as A.I. itself). So we will never be out of the loop. There are just more competitors in the field now.


2. As composers and performers, A.I. is still very primitive, and the only thing fascinating (and listenable) about its output is the nature of the human music that it drew from, i.e. the various sources that it cut from to make that one 'paste'.

3. I asked it to create a piece similar to my solo piano improvisations, and it failed, drawing instead from standard jazz licks, standard Chopin phrases, and, of all things, Turkish music, none of which were even remotely similar to my style (OK, maybe remotely), and its output was crap, artistically speaking, lacking all elements except unadorned note production to a mechanically strict beat. If it improves, great, then we have better music to accompany us through life. If not, the music is at the mercy of humans...",0

How do we learn are these our ideas or isn't true that any of mine is based on others work?

*I know, the difference is the copyright holder*

It was never a problem to steal lyrics or a melody from a nobody it's just a problem if you steal what they have already stolen.
And to stay with Bach, they claim to have copyright on a Triosonata just because an artificial pop band (resp. the companies ghost writer) used a few notes of that 1:1.
And for all this no AI is needed it doesn't makes a big difference, turd is turd and is to recognize by the glorious name of the label, as bigger as more shit it is. In  any branche, music, arts, electronic, fabrics, fashion,

48,We are already oversaturated with music. We don't need additional autogenerated music. The vast majority of musicians are struggling to make even a part time income. Roughly only 20% are making what is considered a full time livable income. That number will shrink because of profit margins for the record labels and companies needing music for advertising and etc.. Soon we may see almost no musicians making even a PT income that includes songwriters and composers. The other really bad part of this is the average listener has been dulled over the decades by bland and auto corrected major label Pop they probably won't even be able to tell the difference between AI and something created and played by a human.

For connoisseurs of music, it is not just how a song sounds, but also the feelings, the intention, the lived experiences of the artist. Music also has a social connection element. Take this song, for example:
/
When you fall
The earth creates a nest
Where you can safely rest your head

When you call
The birds will cease to sing
So your voice can be heard instead

When you cry
The clouds part from the sun
And flowers blossom from the trees

When you're cold
Fire burns the earth
And everyone gets burned like me
/

What a beautiful song about love, about how precious and exalted is someone in your heart, but also how painful this love is. Someone who had this experience launches his feelings into the world and I received them. It created a human connection.

Or take the song written by Billy Boyd:

/
I saw the light fade from the sky
On the wind I heard a sigh
As the snowflakes cover my fallen brothers
I will say this last goodbye
Night is now falling
So ends this day
The road is now calling and I must away
Over hill and under tree
Through lands where never light has shone
By silver streams that run down to the Sea
Under cloud, beneath the stars
Over snow and winter's morn
I turn at last to paths that lead home
And though where the road then takes me
I cannot tell
We came all this way
But now comes the day
To bid you farewell
Many places I have been
Many sorrows I have seen
But I don't regret
Nor will I forget
All who took that road with me
Night is now falling
So ends this day
The road is now calling
And I must away
Over hill and under tree
Through lands where never light has shone
By silver streams that run down to the Sea
To these memories I will hold
With your blessing I will go
To turn at last to paths that lead home
And though where the road then takes me
I cannot tell
We came all this way
But now comes the day
To bid you farewell
I bid you all a very fond farewell

AI might generate something better, and it might resonate with you, but at the end of the day you will know that it was created by a machine who will never, no matter how advanced, will truly understand and get teary eyed about the song, simply because the machine lacks the biochemical apparatus.

There are some legit companies out there that use their own producers, vocalists, lyricists, etc... just as a real music label would- then apply their talent to AI training and output.  Everything you played as examples has the sound quality of 116 bit rate.  It will always take the media power that a music label has, to promote legit artists to make legit music profitable.

62,"Rick Beato keeps repeating that ""people enjoy making music"" and uses this as his answer to the question whether A.I. will make it more difficult for people to become professional musicians.

70,Well video production just got a whole lot cheaper.. If used ethically I can see this being VERY useful to independent individuals who cannot afford to pay A List Artists for music rights for each of their views..

Those artists who feel threatened by AI will indeed be replaced. 

The algorithm can only create from what has already been created, taking the prompt as a variable to customize the result. The product can only possibly be generic - by definition. Udio can create beautifully sounding music and vocals, but not the next master of experimentation like M.Davis nor a really memorable voice like Amy Winehouse.
It will quickly become lost in millions of other very simillar songs, generated or not. 
And majority of people want just that, a variation of what they already listen to, which is fine. But the people that keep seeking new experiences will remain.

Music isn't about rhyming or the tones, or the cords and making a melody...   HUMAN MUSIC is all about INTENTION! That's why we often call musician ""artists""... because isn't about how good their technique is... it's all about their intentions...

Have you heard Brazilian Funk?

117,"Generic?  That's precisely what it is: AI music is farmed from all that is available in the internet (so, all pretty much all music, in effect).  Then again, most 'top 20' hits all sound vaguely similar so, in a way artists who have capitalised on making generic hits have, perhaps unwittingly brought this upon themselves. 

In reality though, it's the record & production companies that have to take responsibility for saturating the 'pop' world with bland, stylised musical output, with as much, if not more emphasis placed on the culture of celebrity, fame, or infamy of the ‚Äòartist‚Äô themselves.  But then why would record and publishing companies care at all about where their revenue streams come from? ‚Äì as long as it keeps on flowing in, they won‚Äôt care a jot.  

In fact, not having to manage temperamental artists, with their constant demands, unpredictable moods and expensive cravings, will be nothing but a positive outcome for them.  If they need to put a band together for the sole purpose of marketing their AI generated output in a live performance scenario, then that would be absolutely fine by them, as all members of any such group would be highly expendable, with an innumerable quantity of performance hungry stand-ins waiting in the wings to replace them.  This wouldn‚Äôt just apply to the front of house singer either;  if real musicians are required to perform live, then the same rationale will be applied to them too.

The optimist in me would like to think that AI will never replace ‚Äòreal‚Äô artists who produce original, engaging and interesting music, but at the pace that AI is progressing I'm not so sure that this conviction is at all well-founded.   There will be vanishingly few who will be able to make a living out of music.

The bottom line is, is that the vast majority of we mere mortals will have to get used the idea of Government controlled Universal Basic Income, as the requirement to do most jobs will become absolutely redundant.

In spite of any wealth or standing, some people will always have the privilege of appreciating profound human experiences. Those who adopt commercial technologies, move to the cities, see ideological banners and advertisement billboards every day, and seek the empty promises of the sensational will always forego what is meaningful. Us truly creative musicians deserve no pity. Even with all the AI technology in the universe, we have inside us an inexhaustible source of meaning from the very heart of humanity. Whether or not we are compensated for sharing this, it is only those who cannot find it within them to accept the gift who will miss out. So my condolences.

If I wanted to develop an indie game totally from scratch and I needed a score, I‚Äôd much rather spend the $20/month subscription to get it done than pay an actual composer. It would still require work to get it all done, just a different kind of work.

Literally anyone. No creativity is needed. at. all. No learning. No mastering. No effort and years of dedication. Nothing. This will dilute the industry and will definitely have an impact on future musicians: why master an instrument, while the riffs I can create with a simple prompt are so much better?

Alas, the process behind AI music (apparently -- it's still a mystery to me what's really under the hood; it sounds mostly like disguised theft to me) is both of those things, too: it ""trains"" on the work of others and then it generates something kind of ""original.""

Music is my greatest passion and part of the enjoyment comes from being ""spiritually"" intimate with other people, the artists. They pour their soul into their music and that makes it special. AI generated music is very hollow in that regard. It doesn't convey the emotion, the experience of another being, it just is. Now, that in itself is fine actually, but I don't want it to become the norm. 

The main problem is that there will be uncertainty about whether any particular piece of new music is at least partly generated by an AI or not. I would be pretty mad if my favorite artist turns out to be using AI in his songs instead of being his creative self. I want to enjoy HIS music, not AI's.

Sometimes I do want to listen to ai generated music as like I said, it's fascinating, but my wish is that it's treated in its own category and there won't be paranoia about artists publishing AI music as their own.",0

No AI will be able to perform in front of an audience. Jazz is the perfect example. Even now most musicians do not make a living streaming their music, but make a living playing live concerts.

I'm sure any of you can think on examples of this, previous public companies being sold by pennies, public housing or public terrain being sold to companies that then increase housing/renting prices like crazy, public education or healthcare being underfunded into uselessness in favor of private education and healthcare, public spaces in your city/town sold to private companies and close of for the public, etc., etc.

With AI we have exactly the same, the collective human effort that has gone into creating all the culture that we have to this day is being compressed into neural networks with the goal of being monetized by just a few huge companies (sometimes small ones, but backed by huge companies/investors). They have gotten all that data for free and have created algorithms that could eventually become the main form of production of future..., let's say, digital content, and you can bet that, once this has been normalized, they will find a way to close the gates so no one else can create their own cheaper or free algorithms that do the same.

Humans can create something from nothing, AI requires the human condition to create something appealing to humans, left to train on itself AI's creativity will devolve to zero, and along the way you'll get mutant abominations no humans deem as art.

When photography came around, it didn't destroy the profession of painting, it only partially replaced some of portrait and landscape painting market share, and many people who either used to be painters, would've become painters if not for photography, and actual painters, became photographers and then improved and refined photography into an art form all of its own.
To this day there are painters that have never touched a photo camera and are creating beautiful and appreciated masterpieces, there are painters that use photography to enhance and improve their paintings, and there are photographers, and specific photographs that, in the eyes of some, rival some of the greatest painters and paintings in history.
There are momentous historical events and seemingly small, but impactful glimpses that could've only been captured by photography.
I'd put CGI, and various forms computer assisted drawing/painting/design etc. in a similar category, it does seem to dilute the perceived prestige of an artform, but it doesn't destroy anything it just creates more avenues for more creation.

One way to 'play' music right now without being a musician is with a modular system, specifically feedback patching, admittedly it's likely to be more of a noise composition.

You jam with it for a magical 5 or 20 minutes or less, then it - leaves - the moment is gone, and upon inspection you realize your phone battery died, that stick must have been nearly full - or the tape ran out!   It's the same sense of loss as when you miss capturing a unique and novel jam session as opposed to just not tracking your best take.   The mad professor analogy definitely works here.

664,"I'm happy to see some of my own views shared by yourself and Beato. There is a sense of loss, as it feels like music must come from a soul. Good music feels transcendent and divine. When someone makes a really great piece of music, it feels as though that artist were sent a revelation from God. They made something that feels as though it was touched by a divine spirit. So seeing AI models produce convincing music is fairly dispiriting in a way. 

At the same time, just as Beato says, this is simply the logical progression of computer aided music creation. We've already had computers and machines helping us make music. It was only a matter of time that someone would come along and invent something like Udio. It can be simply be viewed as yet another tool for artists. As you highlight, it can be used as a sampling tool. That was my own initial thought about it. 

The potential for iterating through ideas quickly, mixing and mastering with more precision, and creating new styles and genres is all exciting. Human beings will never stop creating art, and there will always be people who want to connect with other people through enjoyment of art. Human artists and audiences for human artists aren't going anywhere. The only problems are (1) ensuring we don't make it impossible for people to be full-time artists, and (2) ensuring that the data used to train models like Udio are ethically and justly sourced.",0

666,"I've tried Suno ai to generate some oldschool metal with intent that it's the genre algorithm is less familiar with and I was right, it was mostly bad. It vaguely resembled main genres I asked for during the verses but went almost pop sounding during choruses. Not to mention that everything was muddy and incoherent, not just mixing wise, but it definitely didn't feel like there were separate multitracks mixed together, rather it must have built stereo track with those prompts from the get go rather than building individual elements and building from there.

It didn't inherently understand the music, it was just looking at its spectrogram data and went to produce something statistically similar with its prompts. Humans don't create like that, you come with one particular element that gets stuck with you while jamming, whether a riff, melody, chord progression, rhythm or tone and go from there.

It was obvious that it wasn't trained on all the specific underground artists and all the specific nuances from different songs that fans of music learn by developing the taste and participating in the subculture. Prompt-wise I tried to be somewhat specific but no matter what I wrote it, it just generated whatever it wanted, only recognizing vague subgenre keywords. I felt like I had no control. If I heard something kinda good I could only try to replicate it on real instruments and go from there, the traditional way.

Novelty factor wear off as soon as I spent all the free credits and would have rather just jam on guitar and come up with something in the moment that sounded inspiring and fun and could be arranged in many different ways and exactly how I wanted. This made me realize how process of making art is the key part of making art, not just end product by itself.",0
667,"Rick Beato is correct.  Humans will continue playing instruments because it's still fun.  Also like Rick Beato said, by the time a human musician adds computer-generated drum beats, and other computer-genrated sounds into a song, and then auto-tunes his own voice, then that musician may as well just use A.I. since now his song is basically a heap of synthetic sounds that he trained and prompted through a computer chip using buttons and a graphical interface.  Ai-generated music does almost the same thing except it uses Text prompts instead of buttons and a graphical interface.  Or, maybe a musician records his own guitar track, and then adds in computer-generated vocals, drums, etc.  Consider that electric guitars are synthetic electronic versions of acoustical guitars.  Electric keyboards and sound machines have replaced pianos, drums, etc.  Newer ways to make music have been presenting themselves for 1000's of years.  Music is still music.  Remember Milli Vanilli?  After they got popular, it was found out that they were lip-syncing.  People got mad and wanted their money back.  Not me, I still enjoy Milli Vanilli songs, whoever sang or wrote them.",0

When something like this can integrate a musical prompt from a human, rather than merely being yet-another LLM, then things will get interesting, because then we're talking about copyrightable work that can do anything original. The sample tracks you used to introduce the piece were... generic. Generic to the point of being completely forgettable. It's like most of the AI ""art""; it's not only goofily wrong in places, but if all you use is a text prompt... it's super-generic. Where things get genuinely interesting and powerful with the AI-art stuff is when an artist uses AI to provide final detailing of a piece. This is where I think things go with AI music, too: the text-only versions using a small context window are going to be a brief fad, maybe a couple of genuinely interesting pieces will arrive... but the real deal is going to involve humans plugging in their melodies.",0

I can see myself losing my job as a software developer in 5 years, but then everyone will lose their jobs too. Artists, engineers, doctors, lawyers - AI will do it all and I think it will be good. If no human has to work anymore, then money will become meaningless. AI and robots will run on renewable energy, they will produce our food, run our medical research, do surgical operations, create the art we listen to, etc. Humans will probably become biologically immortal and just do the things they like to do for fun all the time without the constant ticking reminder, that their time is running out.

However, what is happening now is a new kind of violence where computers separate us from each other while giving us the illusion of connection.

You decide which loops play together and when, and arrange them into a complete song. You as a human also make mixing choices regarding the volume of the individual loops, EQ/filtering, transitions, breaks etc.

With AI generated music you literally just write 10-20 words and a complete song comes out. For now you might make some minor choices regarding how the song is extended past ~30 seconds, but this will soon also be completely automated. You could even ask ChatGPT to write the prompt, which further reduces the human input to virtually zero.",0
743,"I am 44 and am moving from an established business in photography to learning how to play finger style guitar.  I will do whatever it takes‚Ä¶for as long as it takes.  I plan to make a living from it. I have literally ZERO fear about AI impeding me from earning a good living.  Why?

Because just the other day I went to a Steve Travino comedy show for the first time.  My wife and I have been watching him for a year on YouTube.  She surprised me with tickets to the live show.

I was‚Ä¶to put it mildly‚Ä¶overjoyed by the experience.  I cannot even begin to communicate how happy I was that night going there with her.  It was one of the Top 10 best experiences of my life.

That‚Äôs all you need to know.  Humans will always seek out and value ‚Äúreal human‚Äù live performances.  They value ‚Äúreal human‚Äù art more.

Think about wall art.  Great painters today sell both ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù paintings and they sell ‚Äúprints‚Äù.  Prints are more affordable and so lots of people can buy them.  But everyone values an ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù more.

People loved songs on record/tape/CD‚Ä¶.and would still go to concerts.  To hear the SAME songs they heard hundreds of times.

Why?

Because there really is ‚Äúsomething‚Äù about being there.

AI Art prints will sell like hot cakes.  But they will be just like buying anything ‚Äúoff the rack‚Äù at Hobby Lobby or Target or Wal-Mart.  That stuff sells well.  It could have been made by ‚ÄúAI‚Äù for years and nobody would have known.  Or cared.  Because when you buy art from there you are not looking for ‚Äúa connection to the artist‚Äù.  You are looking for something inexpensive that fills a spot on the wall and matches the sofa.

AI music tracks will be listened to by plenty of people.  But people will always want to seek out a ‚Äúreal person‚Äù to latch onto and become a fan of.  Once the ‚Äúhype‚Äù of AI music fades it will just become ‚Äúanother great AI song that is great because AI did it‚Äù.  People will differentiate.  They will be like‚Ä¶

 ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶but let‚Äôs find a song a real HUMAN made that is better.  That‚Äôs the REAL deal there bro.‚Äù

I see this as being great.  Because you could be a ‚ÄúYouTube Musician‚Äù who plays covers of famous songs ‚Äúyour way‚Äù.  BUT‚Ä¶.

You don‚Äôt get PAID for those songs.  The artist‚Äôs record company claims all the revenue.

But you could just tell one of these machines to ‚Äúmake a great song‚Äù and give it some parameters that steer of close to ‚Äúyour sound‚Äù and it will.  Then just ‚Äúlearn the song‚Äù like any cover. Tweak it.  Produce it.  Publish it on YouTube.

Now YouTube recommends it to your followers.  If they like it and watch it‚Ä¶YOU get paid.

So it‚Äôs a nice business plan.  Make covers of famous songs.  Get no money for that but think of it as ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù to attract an audience.  

Then pop out songs that are unique to you while working with your own ‚ÄúAI R2D2‚Äù and earn money from those.

It‚Äôs a great and simple business model.  The future is bright for those willing to not be a stuffy, high-brow ‚Äúpurist‚Äù but will instead use the tech to their advantage.",15

As one of those people who has no music knowlege and just wants to create something this is awesome.  My 2 cents - artists can still create that isnt the problem.  Like dude said, AI isnt going to stop him from picking up a guitar.  The real issue is getting paid.  All the fear around AI basically boils down to people being afraid that they wont get paid as much.  Thats a legitimate issue but an issue that is with our current economic system which rewards labor with money.  We need a system where people can live w/o money being exchanged for their laboir as we approach an age where human labor is less valuable.  Thats the bottom line.  And fwe should want that.  The vast majority of human beings arent working b/c they love their jobs.  They are working to pay their bills.",0
759,"Unfortunately I disagree with ur attempt at a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù conclusion here. Being basically ai music won‚Äôt have the same ‚Äúsoul‚Äù that human generated music has and humans will discern that and not appreciate ai generated music the same. Cheers for trying to be positive but I think this is wrong. Bc this ai music will just get better and better at taking the vast amount of our human created music and ripping it off and spitting it out convincingly. 

I‚Äôm a musician. I write and record my music. It‚Äôs painstaking and is a MAJOR time and effort investment and it takes THOUSANDS of hours just learning the process of recording your own music well. This is AFTER the many thousands it takes just to learn your instruments, how to sing, compose etc.. I‚Äôve just in the last 2 yrs become what I consider ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù to feel comfortable releasing my own music. Just in time for suno and udio to crush the last bit of remaining hope of any type of success or even acknowledgement of my music from the world. Frankly there is no positive spin to be gleaned here. Musicians should be ANGRY.. this tech has cheapened our art and expression to near worthless and it‚Äôs done it by (illegally) amalgomizing the full library of every human artist that‚Äôs ever put music online, mine and yours included probably, so that it can convincingly spit out what takes us a spark of inspiration + days or weeks of our time and effort, in under 2 minutes. And most of humanity won‚Äôt be able to tell the difference. Or frankly, once it‚Äôs normalised, even care.  

There is no ‚Äúupside‚Äù for us or ‚Äúpositive takeaway‚Äù. They‚Äôre pillaging our entire history of human creativity and doing so for profit without ANYONE wanting or asking them to. F**k them. I‚Äôd love to believe that the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù of human created art will always prevail but our track record begs to differ. I mean just look at what music is already the most successful BEFORE this came along. Over produced ghost written over processed overtuned drivel performed by basically models instead of the musicians creating it. Why wouldn‚Äôt we fully except ai music? Everything on the radio is already the least organically human version of music we could manage before ai‚Ä¶

Their algo is not just geared to make songs. It's weighted with pop chart ratings and designed to emulate the most popular song in each category. To have a certified banger every time. Sure, it's hit and miss, but when it does hit - it's brilliant. And currently, millions of wannabe musicians are messing with it. Music lagged behind image and video generation, but made a huge leap.

Go on Suno and see their chart toppers. The guy who makes math songs doesn't even speak English. Talk about a gamechanger! People who don't speak English can make best English songs, because they're good at figuring out prompt tricks. This will transform the industry within the next month. In a year, no stone will be left unturned.

Musicians are worried about being devalued? How about my clips where I put hundreds of hours into an edit, and some sound plays for a few seconds that gets claimed, and then the whole revenue goes to the person whose contribution is less than 1% of the end product. You think that's fair? Those elite musicians with a petition are scared they won't hold onto their monopoly. All I want is a standalone model, like Stable Diffusion.

No way I could tell it's AI if I didn't know and in a genre that involves a lot of distortion and other equipment (stoner/desert rock), it sounds 100% authentic. It might help with a whole new generation of musicians to get inspiration or even established bands to come up with new material and ideas if they have writer's block. But then could you consider those artists' work as ""authentic""? I think that won't matter if the result is great and something that people enjoy. Musicians have always borrowed and built on previous work, whether intentional or not.

There's already enough great music out there imagined by humans to last a 100 lifetimes but this can be huge after it gets some traction. Even if it's an AI that can pick the perfect playlist for you in the mood, something that Spotify has been trying with more primitive algorithms but is still not there.

This is terrible in any form if artists aren't compensated in some what for having their rights removed basically by using the content without consent but it should be the same for all things, video, audio, lyrics, tunes, and much more.

Adding a bit to this, my piano has super articulation function/voices that emulate the ""human"" imperfections when playing music, the breath intake when playing a sax, the sharp thung sound of guitars, so we already have electronic/computer assisted functions to emulate these effects, AI is just the next step.",4

In 10 years assuming the techn is allowed to progress - people will mostly ""create"" their own movies, music and even video games from text generation tools.

The beginning with be rough, as industries will become over saturated (already happening, even without a.i.) and the value of production will become so low, prodcing digital content will be like sending an email.

The transition will be similar to when the printing press changed the landscape of calligraphy, or how the personal computer and the worldwide web changed the landscape of content generations from monopolized and controlled industries to people in their homes producing content for 100's of 1000's of people on YouTube and across the web.

And that's ultimately because of how broken our economic system is, the commodification of art, and the overlap that means everything that's highly visible and publicised is only there because a few rich clowns decided it'd be good for their wallets.

There are tons of musicians out there that not only have favorite artists that inspired them but that actually sound like many of those artists. Where is the ethics here?

Same with writing or painting. Basically no author or painter grew up in a vacuum, told himself this art and created something new. They all were inspired by other great artists and used their works as either practice pieces or just inspiration. The nature of the human development is to build upon what is already there. Science would not work for example if you would not use the research and formulas already discovered. The music we listen to today has evolved to this point because each generation of musicians grew up with the knowledge of the music of the past generations.",0

Music can do so many things to tell stories with or without words, to create an atmosphere, and it can be so personal. I haven't done producing, but I have written a few songs, both with lyrics and without, and I feel like AI can't imitate that idea of storytelling and emotion, which is only made stronger by production techniques.

As for music specifically, I can see a way out for those genres in which the live performance of the musicians is an integral part of the appeal.

He probably got too impressed by so much reading and started to have hallucinations about Gandhi. He would see Gandhi around him, in his well-known minimalist white attire and a stick in his hand. If he asked questions, Gandhi would reply. If he asked difficult life questions, Gandhi would offer solutions that were based on his philosophy of truth and nonviolence. When the protagonist found that Gandhi's solutions worked for his life, he went on a radio show and started offering solutions to difficult life problem of the callers. He was having a dream run until a famous psychologist challenged him and asked for a showdown in public. He asked the protagonist some obvious questions about Gandhi, the questions were relayed to Gandhi who replied in an instant and the hero relays the answer to the public. Then the psychologist asked questions about not-so-popular facts of Gandhi's life for example the name of his mother. That time, the hallucination of Gandhi didn't even move his lips. Few more such questions followed. The psychologist proved his point and the protagonist was shattered.

On the other hand, neural networks can be considered just another very advanced tool that helps a person compose music. And this is the key point. The intention to compose music comes from a person. The neural network itself has no desire to compose music. At least for now. 
From a third perspective, this can be even perceived as a kind of musical postmodernism. 
In general, if a person composes music for self-expression, then the presence or absence of neural networks will not affect this in any way. If he does this for the sake of money and fame, then all his objections to neural networks are very reminiscent of the irreconcilable struggle of diggers with shovels and excavators. We have a market economy. If you want to compete with neural networks, be better than neural networks. It's that simple!

As for musicians who give live concerts, neural networks are generally a benefit for them. Because they will now have a lot more good music to play live.

Because of the nature of the synthesizer, the voice produced have no limitation of human vocals, which then music producers used to create music based on extreme or near impossible singing. It removes the limitation of what music can feels and heard in Japan, and create a new spectrum of music genre.
These music are always covered by 'utaite' (cover singer) because the producers allowed the public to cover their songs. And somehow, the 'utaite' also covered the 'extreme' vocaloid song, and pushed their limit of singing in terms of speed, dynamic, and tonality. And from here, some singer managed to emerged as mainstream artist in Japan such as Mafumafu, Ado, Reol, Piko and others.

I‚Äôm curious about how this technology will influence an individual‚Äôs desire to learn and invest in purchasing physical musical instruments. If I can prompt an AI to create a guitar-based song that I enjoy listening to, where is the motivation to purchase a guitar and learn to play it myself? Similarly, what does this mean for professional studio musicians? Will we see a decline in young people learning to play an instrument to a professional standard as a career choice?",1

And because of this, after some time of use, you start to hear a pattern of output and no experiments at all.

So I believe that the future is for AI, which will not try to replace musicians, but will be an additional tool for them.",0

1249,"I have no doubt that popular musicians as a phenomenon will survive because their art is also fueled by celebrity, but i think that commercial art, for less glamorous use will definitely be phased out of human hands, even if the US bans or stops these AI companies, a different country will still cultivate them and gain advantage in the market, and stopping the export of that will require something like China's great firewall, which will just fragment the world even more. I would also think its extremely narcissistic to pretend to understand creativity as a purely human trait while having no knowledge about how human brains work in that direction, which is the case for most artists who feel that their livelihoods are being stolen (justifiably, i would be angry too). The assumption that art is uniquely human is based on emotion and self aggrandization, not reason. Conveniently we humans have the honor of designating what is sentience and personhood, and the only entities we believe are worthy of that are ourselves. We will keep moving that goalpost of sentience further and further away, and because human understanding of sentience relies not being able to understand how human brains create (which btw we have a very good idea how they work), while we think that anything we create or understand enough to create cannot be ""special"". Generative platforms operate on the same learning methods as humans, except at a much more efficient rate, and with their input data being more controlled. The input data human brains receive is not controlled, it is the entirety of the data our senses collect and register in our lifetimes, or at least how much ever we can remember.  We translate that into art, but the bots do the same, its just that their input data can be put on a list and is a lot more concentrated in a particular direction. Our data ranges from last weeks grocery shopping trip to the 2014 Brazil vs Germany Football world cup match. We take ownership of their learning with copyrights, we  call them plagiarists while touting us as creatives when creating something out of nothing is impossible, which we do know. AI has no lived experience is the current rhetoric we use. Sadly commercial sectors don't care about that, they care about the cost per unit. As much as i would like to debate human narcissism, the truth is unless there is a global Butlerian jihad on generative platforms, the replacement of below the line creatives is going to be inevitable for commercial use at least. Personal use and personal art will always thrive as long as humans and any other entity we hopefully accept as sentient in the future, have the means.",1

Chunks, i have to  separate in stems, stems to midi, midi to music sheet, and look for a production leading to a sound i never made. Real artists are people wwho are channeled, what i call the overflow state, in this wthellisit state of consciousness, things happened u don't even remember having thinking, u don't feel being the author. Ai will never do that. Great, some music changing musicians i've been workin with don't know any chord, were said to be bad in english and finally acclaimed lyricist, shy and beasts on stage. All of the great i collaborated with in fact, 2 handful, that's a lot, been lucky. We all got a pen. Who's Bukowski or Shakespeare in the neighboorhood ? The same people being against AI today would have been the one against the generalization of writing and reading. We all got a brain... No comment. It's a tool and a cool tool and anyway, it doesn't break the rules. SO u still have to do it yourself.I misprompt to create accidents, we know the importance of accidents ain't it ? I'll work a full month probably on this song to test, master , install this new workflow, using hit n mix btw wich is made for this, then back to bitwig, or back to a local ai,etc etc, new recipes. it won't be faster to create this song. even longer as i created too many ""takes"", variations. like movie rushes. Making the listening time, choosing time, changing ur mind and refeed the ai, replay on it, replay without it, and the global editing time very long. And musicians will still wear a violet costume and find others musicians to put a band together, and move teir asses to play gigs wherever they find a place needed gigs. I do think we'll have awesome performers, and those people will dedicate their life to what they have to say, music being a medium. and only a few will accept poverty to be free. I personnaly don't know many people having something to say. not so many people giving me the chills because how they give, move, shake, sing, sound, groove and expose their raw power as much as their naked vulnerability. Midjourney is producing millions of copies of scifi pics and marvel shit. U have to live with ur time, said Arthur Rimbaud. Ai will alow people to make music that would never have had the opportunity to. Probably some of them will once again change music and some people life forever again. And the true showmen wil be the ones. As with image generaitve AI we'll see tyhe true poets.

If you look at the impact AI has had on Photography so far where a prompt can create an incredibly complex surreal work of art; the industry seems to moving towards making much more mundane, film photos, events and weddings are still very highly valued. These are things that are can't be generated with AI easily or even at all in some circumstances and likely never will be. (Of course we can get close to making film but not exactly and the patience of a film image IS something people feel through portraiture etc.) Story is becoming so much more important in design and art as a result of what these new tools can do. 

However I think the music industry will go the other way. We're likely going to see a breakdown of genres from musicians and artists as AI won't know how to recreate this, there won't be ways to immitate this easily.

What's stopping artists that play exclusively AI generated music, that build a brand from executing it so well and being likeable people, that they too can start at small shows working their way to selling out stadiums? Currently as it is, it isn't anywhere near rational to spend around $1000 in total to spend one night watching somebody play music from 300 metres away when you can go on YouTube to watch them play the same music with the best view possible. Kind of like with sports, spend $100 minimum and 2 hours to have a horrible view of the game, vs being able to spend $2 maybe to be on your couch, no travel time, with a fridge full of snacks and the best angle and framing all throughout the game.",0

Imagine an AI created Eminem from the early 2000s. Would that be as successful? Also the numbers game is over. The charts aren't as relevant anymore. Many musicians go indipendent with building a strong fan base and the majority of them is getting paid by shows and merch. They don't even make much off of their plays. They often make more money than some famous artists because they keep most of their profits and you probably haven't ever heard of them. The times of linear media are over. You can see this with YT.

We're just going to adapt and utilize what we can from it, while still being human and creating human art just with this either streamlining it or helping us get to some point that we were expecting to get to a lot sooner.
I like to believe that real art in the future is going to be way more rare and way more expensive, whereas generative art and media like we're seeing now is going to be so, Official and spread out, but personal at the same time. It just puts the power that the producers in these big companies like Hollywood and stuff into the people's hands, the general public's hands.

It seems the vast majority of jobs where AI strives, are artistic in nature and people in that industry enjoy their work more than the average worker in other professions. It's a shame that AI currently is on the path to replace workers in industries where people love their jobs. I'd love to see a solution where AI could help us out in professions which most people consider a burden and dislike doing. Or have AIs focus on tasks where humans really lack the knowledge and where there is a shortage in that profession. Imagine having an AI that is as good as a general practitioner doctor. At the moment when you Google for medical symptoms, even just for a cough, you will most likely end up on an article that will tell you, you have cancer and have died yesterday. ChaGPT is already much better at those things and genuinely helped me steer medical questions in the right direction, away from my biased approach of thinking the worst. How amazing would it be to see the next gen AI to be able to accurately make basic medical assessments, using visual input from you phones camera, take into account your recorded physical activity from your watch, including current heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen level. Possibly having a small device like we currently have to test for blood sugar, except it will be able to read a lot more information from your blood sample (like Theranos once wanted, except for real). An AI would be able to diagnose you instantly with high accuracy, possibly better than your local overworked GP. Additionally it could not only help you get a diagnosis for your current illness, but help with preventative care for serious diseases for which we don't show symptoms until it's often too late. Most of the technology seems to be already here, AI, phones, smart watches. It's just a matter of connecting the dot in a way to make it work properly.",0

My rebuttal is that you don't understand how these tools work. I have tried a few of them, and you frankly aren't going to get a decent finished product after a couple text prompts. Go use one, and you will find that you absolutely can get art out of them, but not without direction. Bad AI art says more about the person generating the prompt than the tool being used.
The most concrete example I can give is how I use AI to generate powershell code. With 10-15 minutes of prompts I can get the bones of a pretty complicated script generated (and beautifully formatted!). But it has never once created something good enough that I could simply use it in the life work environment as-is. That would be a resume generating event lolüòÖ. No, I still need to know how it works, how it behaves, what the unintended concequences might be to other systems that the AI has no context or awareness of, etc. My role becomes more of a director or manager, then I review the work, fix some potential issues, and then deploy it.
The same is true for text, image, video, and music generation. AI tools allow an absolute novice to pump out something lightyears beyond what they are capable of doing themselves... But an absolute novice isn't going to see the issues, or understand how to fix them. Skill, knowledge, experience and expertise is still going to be required to create art using these new tools. The AI is just filling in the lines, it isn't driving the direction. Fail to give AI direction and you don't get much of anything impressive most of the time unless it is an extremely narrow scope AI trained to do something very specific.

When people talk about AI destroying jobs, the fear isn't that a ceo can just fire all of the creatives on staff and replace them with a bot and their own brilliantly unhinged prompts. No... That wouldn't end well. The fears are one of 2 possibilities.
1) a team of creatives could be replaced by 1-2 creatives and a very competent AI tool, leaving a few high paying jobs, and a lot of people unemployed because there isn't enough work to be done.
2) The tools still require hard earned skills to use properly, but the pay and value of the work to be done becomes so low that nobody bothers to learn the skills, and the talent ages out and we lose the talent to create art.

And both of these arguments are made with every generation of new tools... And they have always been wrong. Go look at commercials and packaging from 20+ years ago and compare it to well done versions of the same style today. You didn't notice just how bland and empty and lacking in detail and ""unfinished"" the old works were until you compare it to similarly talented people (or the same people) using modern tools. If given enough time, an art project can continue improving almost indefinately. Modern tools just allow for time to be compressed.
The question, and fear, in my mind isnt if these tools will be more effective and allow for better art faster as the tools mature (because let's face it, all AI tools lack specificity of controls to be as powerful as they need to be to be useful. Some maturity needs to happen to gain traction). The fear in my mind is that of acceleration.
With every previous tool it has taken the order of multiple decades to fully out-mode and replace the previous generation of tools. This has allowed older professionals to gracefully age out in mass, with a few juniors picking up consolidated remaining work while the majority of the next generation comes in with the new tools, and a more native understanding on how to use them. My fear is that these new tools are going to be able to replace the old tools and workflows in less than a decade from a true first Gen commercial product release. That is going to displace a lot of people unwilling, unable, or lacking access to these new tools to be able to compete. There will still be high demand and pay for quality artists, and the workforce will have a lot of young people still learning their trade, and a lot of talent tossed out because they can't compete on cost and efficiency with their older workflows. Apply that to the creative fields and you get some artistic whiplash for a decade as people learn and tools mature. But apply that to finance, networking, security, logistics... Military applications... I mean, no offence to the artists, but get on board with learning the new tools and yall are going to be fine. But the potential knowledge gap in other fields as seasoned pros get pushed out and new pros go through their teething phase on immature tools... It is going to have some real world concequences that everyone is going to feel. At best we will be in for a difficult and unpredictable decade.

Fory own game plan, I'm aiming at a 2-part strategy. I'm learning these new tools where and when I can... There is some frustration as the tools keep changing scope and behavior, but learning nonetheless. The other strategy I'm trying to follow is to invest as much as possible as quickly as possible so that when the bumps in the economy and job market come, then I can better weather any gaps in employment. üòÖ It's going to be a wild ride, and the only thing more wild is to try to imagine what next-next Gen tools of hyper accelerating efficiency will become possible once this round of tools actually get broad deployment and use. Or will we get a little breather while other industries catch up to enable the next transition?",0

1437,"For the last 16 years, I've been making music with various software. I'd say I have reasonable music knowledge, but I also lack the ability to adequately play any instruments, other than playing bass along to some simple Ramones songs. Anyhow, I've gotten into a couple algorithmic midi note generators that have been quite fun to play with. However, I must note that I don't just have it spit out notes, slap a synth over it and put a beat behind it. There's a ton of chopping things up, arranging, sound design and so forth. As such, I see these AI generations tools as just that...a tool for me to overcome my inability to play an instrument well. Udio was fun for like 30 seconds but it's just something a program spits out. Eventually I could see something like it being good for generating vocal samples or maybe a breakbeat...but there's no satisfaction in writing a prompt and having it decide what it sounds like.

I didn‚Äôt care about sports whatsoever so my time was spent collecting the ‚Äòmost popular‚Äô songs from each recommended artist and then proceed to learn all about the people who created my favourite music. Especially if the music was enough to literally blow my mind. I used to idolize certain bands and see them as superheroes if they were able to invoke something within me. Eventually I‚Äôd just scroll through the album artworks I‚Äôd collected over time as if they were trading cards on my iPod.

I expect we'll in short order be able to provide our finished tracks drafted so far and get another track or tracks to flesh it out.  Such as a drum track, or a guitar or sax solo, vocals, etc.

I have rhythm deafness. For years, science thought it didn't exist, but experiments showed that what happens to people with rhythm deafness is that if a sound is too regular, the brain gets bored and tunes it out. The problem with computers playing all the instruments and autotune is that the sound is too regular. There isn't enough variation in it to hold the interest. Live music or recordings of musicians playing the music is what pleases people like me. Even a piece I love, like Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D-minor, played by a machine, I soon tune out.

I know there is actually a lot more to it, and the speeds at which computer systems can ingest this data and learn from it is on an entirely different level to humans...but at some level, isn't it really the same thing? you know what classical music is because you were trained on it, you've heard loads of classical music in your lifetime and been taught that music from composers like Bach and Beethoven are ""classical"", and after being told ""that music is classical"" enough times, you get it, if you hear certain melodies, scales, chord structures etc., you identify that as ""classical"", you as a person don't get any ""copyright"" limits imposed on you, if you sit around listening to Pink Floyd all day and then go on to create a ""Pink Floyd sounding"" song that's completely original, no one's discussing the ethical implications of you sitting around and listening to Pink Floyds copyrighted content.

- It‚Äôs a matter of years before humanoid with AI will replicate human behaviors. Heck or even shows like Gorillaz but fully AI.
- AI doesn‚Äôt pay well. Most musicians that aren‚Äôt in the 10% top aren‚Äôt making enough to make enough just to break even on some tours. And AI does nothing to help here.

Also I‚Äôd add that a lot of artists make a living doing ‚Äúsilly‚Äù music related jobs in order to make ends meet. Like doing a music for an advert, sync etc‚Ä¶ If AI takes 95% of these jobs. Musicians will struggle even more than they do today -> Push them to do other jobs -> less time to create -> probably even less means to go live.
That without mentioning than less time to create can lead to using more AI logically. As it creates quicker -> More AI content -> AI training on AI. Lol.

The only thing I could see to be positive out of this without being too naive is the emergence of alternative medias created by creators for creators and people that‚Äôd like that. Just like YT vs TV in a way. So the 100% AI music will be left for charts and mainstream formulaic uniformity. While the indie scene will thrive using it differently and mixing with more human sensibilities.

1584,"You shouldn't be too quick to judge this as a creative killer imo. While it can generate the whole thing, it will be able to do so with all media and data tbf. The copy pasted interface and concept of Suno and Udio respectively, isn't representative of the best way to make music in the future. In my opinion, you are likely to see a platform or a network of interfacing agents that employ various capabilities to enable YOU as the creative, and your agency, more so than anything else. Because we desire to express ourselves like that. And with regards to AI, it will be made into whatever suits us the best. And it isn't to substitute creativity. That much is certain imo. And I think this will manifest for art, video games and videos in addition to music. You CAN tell GPT to make a story for you. But you ultimately want to tell the story that you've had perkulating in your head right? Obviously. And that's what the tech will be refined to do for sure.

With regards to Udio (Suno is shit imo, not worth my time for my niches), it has potential. If you've used it (I've used my entire monthly quota), you might notice that it's biggest issue apart from the usual gripes with this tech (intelligence, training data, prompt adherence, etc) is that it obviously lacks the proper context window in it's public beta phase. It only generates 33s(32s now) segments individually each time. And you can extend them or remix. You can only do this for each segment with that size, so it cannot be remixed as a whole. It obviously doesn't have the context window to accomodate a longer segment, and it cannot establish coherent consistency, because it only acknowledges each adjecent segment. This makes it almost impossible to create proper songs with looping choruses that don't surface every segment, because it has to do so for Udio's generative application to pick up on it. It essentially treats the song as if it was a maximum of three segments. I.E: ------ Segment 1 ------- Segment 2 (you are here) ------- Segment 3. In this case, the second second segment is where you are currently. It hasn't yet generated either segment 1 or 3, depending on whether or not you have chosen to extend forwards or backwards. Once you do so, it will erase the furthest most from memory.

View it from my perspective, as someone who loves non-generic music (entire suno training data), and feel like the good parts of genres got left in the dust and was never done justice(nu-metal/alternative, bunch of rock and metal genres from just the late 90s/early 00s in general) as it lays wasted on the ground, I need a tool like this to help interrogate/generate unique sounds from the past that I resonate with, and is representative of that time. And that's frankly irreplaceable to me. I don't know shit about music production, but like all other iterations of ""agents"" that are now coming forward and is going to be announced in the future, it removes the barrier to entry. I've always wanted to create both music and video games, and I never thought I was gonna be able to get into either for real, but this tech changes literally everything. The age of ideas comes straight to me. It's amazing imo. Obviously relate to people's worries about it replacing creativity, but I'm pretty sure you will see the opposite emerge in our culture as it develops. Because it replaces labour, and as it does that, creativites will become waaaay more in demand. This IS going to remove jobs. But as it transitions, new jobs will emerge. This is what always happens in history when major stuff like this comes around. It's just part for the course.",0
1585,"Not a musician, but I've written lyrics for fun. I've tried both and have preferred the Suno results over Udio.

Don't get me wrong Udio did a good job, but I found Suno understood what I was asking for a bit better.

If we ever get to the point where you can collaborate with a generative music AI; maybe tell it how you want lyrics phrased, change notes for the melodies/harmonies, ""make this a quarter note, change this word to that word"", etc. Like if you could actually sing raw audio into a mic and tell it ""like this, but cleaned up and change it to (gender) vocals and raise the key""...

That kinda thing I think would be great for those like you mentioned who have ideas but currently don't have the musical skills to execute even a demo-level track.

I've been around the acting/writing side of the industry and know how hard it is to make that your only job, so I understand why creatives who actually make a living off their craft don't like AI.

Personally though, I'd love for AI to remove the friction that currently exists in the creation process (cinema, music, games, all of it), especially for ideas that require a big budget.",0

And ultimately so many genres that haven‚Äôt been composed or widespread because of difficulty or lack of time with creativity, i‚Äôve already made a few that weren‚Äôt  particularly easy but the feeling is never lost in translation that i care less about who is behind it more so the fact what my mind gets from the story.",0

1608,"As a musician, I am concerned about the rigorous enforcement of copyright checks on artistic works, particularly when those works are not outright copies of another‚Äôs creation. This concern stems from observing that some human artists, especially those without innate talent, develop their art in a manner similar to how AI operates. Both human artists and AI draw extensively from existing works‚Äîhumans by observing and emulating; AI by processing large datasets. Although AI can assimilate and reinterpret these influences at a much faster pace and on a significantly larger scale, the fundamental process of learning and creating remains the same. This is why I believe that unless a work is a direct and clear imitation, stringent copyright scrutiny risks overlooking the essential nature of creativity shared by humans and AI. A more nuanced approach to copyright enforcement is necessary, one that recognizes this shared creative process rather than creating divisions simply because AI is involved.This perspective does not ignore the potential of AI's continued advancement to significantly impact the livelihoods of human artists. I am deeply concerned about the future if there are no measures like universal basic income to support artists, given the transformative changes AI may bring to the creative industries.",0

While I agree with all the assumptions of the video even the ones by the amazing 'Rick Beato'. But (although maybe I'm over thinking it), I think the assumptions will simply be temporary.
Thing is, these amazing AI capabilities (not just in the music creation, but all other generative AI ones), are due to - as mentioned in the video: ""training data"".
- Now with generative AI, we will have tons of new AI (generated or assissted by) contents (regardless: text, audi, images and video), 
- Next iterations of training data (say next versions of AI tools) will have instead of 100% original human contents from original iteration; now will gradually be filled with AI generative ones,
- By iterations we're talking about loops of training materials based on outcomes of previous AIs,
From above, I am certain that in the near future, quality of the training materials will go down drastically, and for AI, training materials are a thing, without it they're just an empty wikipedia software.

Art is a HUMAN endeavour. AI generated content (music/images/video) is not art. Yes, its very clever, and I respect the technology of it (I am a software engineer). But I want to experience the HUMAN aspect that makes art what it it.
If you use AI to make 'art' you are NOT an artist - you are a prompt manipulator.
Art is a creative endeavour, and in pursuing that activity you are imbuing it with your human lived experience. That is partly what makes art so special, in addition to the skill and creativity of the artist. That is what I want to experience, as a consumer/viewer/listener of that output.
Artists should absolutely be able to exclude their art from the corpus of the learning models. It is a breach of copyright for the AI creators to scrape an artists work without permission.

The mistakes in music are what makes it so good and filled with emotion.  Stuff like Zeppelin is so raw and powerful because it is real.  Jimmy Page had some amazing solos that were actually a bit sloppy in places.  The echo of the bass drum in Kashmir adds so much to that song.  21st century music is striving for perfection and it has taken a lot of the heart out of the music itself (not the lyrics so much).

1935,"Its capacity to equal or even exceed their abilities could make some people feel threatened. But instead of seeing it as a danger, see it as a chance for development. AI in music democratizes creativity by enabling anybody to make original music without the need for specialized training or a lot of time to learn. It's about increasing access and allowing more people to express their creativity, not about displacing artists. Imagine having music made just for you, according to your own likes and tastes. AI gives you the ability to customize your musical experience while conventional musicians create for a wide audience. due to AI , you may now compose music that truly expresses your unique style.

At least Microsoft bought GitHub before training their copilot but these people straight up steal and its ok.",0
1958,"The other, less spoken-about, issue with AI is how does it handles changes. Let's say you were 70% happy with the result of your AI song, how do you keep what you want and improve the rest? How do you, as a commercial artist, take feedback and implement just the necessary changes? With AI, you could argue that the prompt needs to be different, but because everything is basically generated from a noise pattern, there's no way to say ""keep everything except the string section which needs to be more mournful and in a minor key"". AI can't do that. Taking something, identifying the specific parts you want improved or changed, and outputting exactly what you imagined is not yet possible.",0

1963,I wonder if PROMPTS can get a copyright protection?,0
1964,here's the problem with the theory that music is over. people that make music don't do it because they need to make a living they make it because it's rewarding and ultimately a means of expression. Those that go this ai route will probably never feel inclined to learn an instrument or production in general leaving them with only iterations of prompts.,0
1965,"It's also a thing about valuing human life, liberty and happiness in general. It's less about 'will people make art' its more about will we support human life even if AI can do everything we do better? Artists are already and have already been struggling to make a living as artists. In fact I would say that the vast majority of Artists (musicians, painters, filmographers, etc...) do not and have not been able to make a living on just their art for the last 40 years.

Housing is a human right, so is healthcare, freedom of movement, access to pure water, childcare, education, good nurturing food. Give people these things and they will make more and better art than they ever have before. Maybe it will be better than that of AI, maybe it will be worse, but it will always be cherished.",0
1966,"The things that people don't understand. As Rick Beato said, no one is able to force you to stop doing the things that you love. And I will add to that, just don't expect to make money from that.

People will prefer to use AI-generated content for their work (sounds, textures, voices, etc. for my video game) or hobbies (creature or character images for my TTRPG campaign), because they are better, faster (literally on-demand), and cheaper. But we will continue to value human talent and effort.
I will still pay to watch a band that I love perform live because it's a different experience, but I will not pay to get their songs in digital form when I can just have my AI assistant generate better music for when I work or play.
I will still pay to watch athletes compete against each other in a sport that I like, be it club or national level, but I will prefer to have my AI assistant generate a movie that I want to watch instead of paying a platform like Netflix to search something that I may like made by humans.",0

There's a big difference between an AI track that mimics sounds (could be badly produced already) and an producer who separates sounds and puts them in the best light.

And AI music currently sounds terrible.",0

2029,"One thing to understand about music or any other art is that it is not created in a vacuum.  It draws inspiration and influence from prior works.  If one looks at pop music it follows a narrow set of formulas that dictate song length,  tempo, chord progressions, common  sets of structured verses and choruses, riffs/line cliches.  Musicians borrow and transmute what has be written and played at the time.  The great artists can do that without making it obvious or even obscuring prior influences.

The basic problem is that this is precisely how human musicians learn as well, we learn by listening to music already created by others, almost all of it copyrighted. So in the event that such training is declared to be a copyright violation, both AI and human musicianship will come to a complete standstill. There will simply be no new music, period. Or at least none that anyone will bother to promote. Listening to your favorite artist would become a crime if you then proceed to create music clearly influenced by that artist. The thing is, we already have a system that decides such issues. If a song seems just a bit too derivative of another song or artist, and you can prove the creator of the new song was exposed to the older piece, the existing copyright holder can sue, and a jury will eventually decide if there was infringement. Honestly, I don't expect that to change with AI music. Training on existing work simply cannot be disallowed, or all new music comes to a halt. But anything that strays too close to an existing work will face court challenges. Just as it always has.",1

2103,"Just make it illegal for AI to train on copyrighted music, including services like ChatGPT, Sora, and similar. Current AI does not foster a better future; rather, it might do the opposite. People might no longer invest time in learning skills, instead relying on AI to perform tasks for them. While this might increase productivity, it could also lead to greater dissatisfaction and depression. Without personal investment, nothing retains value anymore. Consider a beautiful image‚Äîone that captivates and showcases the artist's talent and hard work. If produced by an emotionless machine, its worth diminishes almost to zero. You could make a new one with just a click of a button.

In the past, purchasing music‚Äîlike an album‚Äîwas a special experience. You brought it home, listened to all the tracks, read the lyrics, and let your favorites evolve over time. It held value. Now, services like Spotify reduces music to individual tracks in an auto generated playlist, diluting the experience. You change the track if it doesn't catch your attention after 5 seconds. AI-generated music could devalue this further. When music is seen as just another computer-generated output, it loses its significance.

Moreover, creativity is already waning as people increasingly consume rather than create, spending time scrolling, just observing others on social media. A lot of modern songs recycle old melodies and lyrics, and new films frequently reboot previous plots. AI exacerbates this trend by relying on existing works to generate ""new"" content, which is often just recycled material. It's quite humorous to read that Open AI is looking for more data to train on. That actually requires people to compose and write stuff, on their own, not guided by an AI. 

I strongly believe we should curtail AI's role in creative domains. It's essential to preserve human creativity, now more than ever, as society shows increasing tendencies towards reuse rather than genuine innovation.",0

It has the potential to liberate composition to the masses and inspire musicians to create works based on its output. Technology has already negated the need for a large recording studio. Hit records can be mixed and mastered in someone's bedroom. Scores can be written without the need for pen and manuscript. 

The problem is it will result in a world saturated by music to the point where human artists will struggle to compete.

And yet, there is something about a performance of an instrument or vocal that makes it unique to the musician singing or playing. I've yet to find any Brass samples that sound like the real thing. 

The one thing AI will never be able to replicate is musicians performing live. Having a symphony orchestra, big band or any ensemble performing live in the same space is something you cannot experience on a recording. It's not just the sound.

2153,"There are a few key points that were not fully discussed in the video:

1. Artists and musicians will likely embrace AI to elevate their work, much like they did with computers. The average person, with limited music knowledge, may struggle to compete with artists leveraging advanced AI in the near future. However, this complexity could evolve over generations. (it's a far more complex matter in the distant future over the next few generations though)

2. Skilled musicians will still have a place, especially as live performers. There's a human element we simply can't overlook ‚Äì we enjoy witnessing another human display feats of talent that resonate with us, even if it's not as good as a computer's or an animal's (i.e. both sides of the spectrum, presuming that AI will still exceed humans).

3. Building on the previous point, our fascination with celebrities stems from various psychological factors that have been ingrained since ancient times. We don't harbor the same feelings towards AI as we do towards celebrities. Despite the potential superiority of AI-generated content, our inclination to worship and celebrate real-life artists will endure. This phenomenon is evident with certain artists who, despite not being exceptional, attract massive followings solely due to this human element (e.g. I know many musicians or multidisciplinary so-called artist in several countries who gathered huge following just because of their looks, personality, story, or their success, say as an actor, which helps boosts their profit as a musician albeit a subpar or sometimes horrible one. People will still do this... and these so called artists will also leverage AI to improve while leveraging their fan base)

However, generic art, music, and video content created for decoration, gaming, advertising, and wanna-be productions will likely be produced using AI sooner rather than later, if not already. The Ai generated music will satisfy steamers and music enthusiast who are not concerned with the actual artists but the concert goers and common people will probably still idolize certain artists. 

It's hard to predict what will happen, but the industry will definitely evolve and the art itself will change, and despite being a musician, I think that's exciting.",0

2162,"I feel like from now on the market will be absolutely flooded with AI-generated songs and sooner rather than later people will 
just stop investing in traditionally composed music, becasue it's more expensive and time consuming. 
From now on you'll either be one of the top-ten best selling songwriters, or you will be basically ignored for good.
Let's face it: music is just another way of making money for some people. 

I'd say a normal person who isn't a music genius can't record a decent song in less than an hour. 
Using AI, I could generate a hundred brilliant songs right now and upload them online. 
I could do it every day and release a thousand albums each year. 
Even if these tracks end up attracting significantly less audience than other more popular songs, 
I will still have put zero technical effort in making them and by comparison I'll be more successful.
Hand-made music won't just disappear, but it will become just another way of making music.
Making music by hand has become the difficult way of making music and most people will just prefer to use AI tools rather than learn to play an instrument and experiment with production softwares. 
Music will not perish but it will be starved, as no one will ever be seriously encouraged to enbarc on a musical career 
by composing and performing music themselves. 
The possibility to procedurally generate music itself is a giant scientific breakthrough and a good thing, 
but the way we as a society are bound to exploit it will just ruins us.

If all radio stations, all movie soundtracks, all studio albums and all background music can be just replaced by AI generated 
sons made within seconds for free, what industry is ever going to invest money and time in real musicians again, 
apart from the musicians themselves?
And if to the average listener there is no real difference between AI music and traditional music, than who'se going to 
complain if real artists get replaced by people who just press a button and spam the internet with their stuff?
And even if you still have musicians performing live or going on tour, who will bother to compose new songs when you can 
simply generate them and than play them like you wrote them yourself? 

In the best case scenario, hand-made music will be reduced to a fraction of the global music output by the end of next year.
By the end of the decade we'll be lucky if we still can find a new artist who makes their music themselves.
Because it's not about old artists, who already know what making music feels like. 
It's about new potencial artists, who run the risk of never getting to know music as a lifestyle.

It doesn't matter what these companies say and how they phrase it: 
in the end they will all profit by pushing us aside; they know it and they have no intention of wasting their chance.",0

1) The best human musicians will keep on having an edge over AI as the best artists understand not only the math behind music, but also the emotion. AI will never be able to, at least not intentionally any time soon, create that certain combination of music and lyrics, at the just right moments, to create that well known goosebump part of the song that triggers an intense emotion that people will remember. Take Kurt Cobain for example. Not a great singer, nor a great musician. Pretty decent poet. But he managed to find just that right combination that made an entire generation dive right back into emotionally intense punk like never before. There was a rawness to his voice and music that make him forever remembered as one of the greats in music history despite his short career. I very much doubt that AI will get there before AI is actually capable of feeling emotion.

2252,"While AI music generation has made impressive strides, as of now and the foreseeable future, it can primarily replicate existing musical styles. For younger generations interested in becoming musicians, I'd recommend taking the self-taught path.
In my experience, those formally educated in music tend to create works that sound similar to what already exists. AI does this just as well, if not better. However, self-taught musicians often develop a unique, unorthodox style that current AI struggles to replicate.
For example, I've composed original songs with weird, unconventional elements that AI just can't seem to generate accurately. My music comes from an organic, personal place that defies straightforward replication by an algorithm trained on existing styles.
That said, if you prefer more conventional, ""normal"" music, then by all means, create what resonates with you. As for me, I'm a weird guy who enjoys weird music, so I end up making unique stuff that AI can't (yet) recreate.
In the end, both human creativity and AI generation have their strengths. But for those seeking to carve out a truly novel musical path, the self-taught route may be the way to go.

2283,~ Hi. What I like about AI music is the lack of ego... great!,10
2284,"15:49 - When it comes to training data I have mixed feelings. I mean training an AI on information found on the open internet to me is the same thing as a human listening and seeing things on the open internet. There is no artist that made a song generated 100% from scratch. Every artist was inspired by things they see and hear. Your experiences form your ideas. As a human...that would be your training data. You made music based on what you hear from others with your spin on it. But nobody cares until your not a human like an AI and make music based on what you hear from others with your spin on it. Once the training data is downloaded to memory banks rather than remembered by a brain then all of a sudden its a big deal. weird al yankovic made a living off of this. He is not AI. Nobody is upset. People go on american idol and sing your song and then get famous and rich and nobody is upset. But once an AI does it then its a problem. And I don't see a difference. I kinda feel like humans are just butt hurt that AI prototypes are making music better than they are and/or faster than they are and/or more complex than they are and thats upsetting to artist. I welcome this tech. Photoshop upset a lot of artist by giving the skill to anyone rather than just them. New artist that could not before are now doing art. Fruityloops and synths had artist upset. But Fruityloops made it so that me...a person that never had an instrument nor do I know how to play and now I with Fruityloops I have produced over 700 beats without hiring an artist. Stable Diffusion made it so I can generate high quality images anytime I want without hiring an artist. I can make cool things to mod into games instantly or not even do anything with the high quality art generated. Before that would be expensive and the artist might not make what I wanted but still wants to get paid. And soo I will be able to make full tracks or remixes of my favorite songs without asking the artist to do it and having to pay him or her to do so. Maybe I want to hear a track with 2-Pac and Drake. And so a regular person at home can now do this without bothering an artist or being charged 100k for Drakes time. If anyone has ever used Square Space for a website...you avoided having to pay a web master to make a website for you which could have costed you hundreds or thousands to maintain that site and now you don't have to do that in order to have a high quality website. When disruptive tech comes out...people get upset. Like Calculators. A job where a person is hired to perform mathematical calculations. They were butthurt when the calculator was invented because we no longer had to pay them for accurate calculations. The ones that get upset are always the ones we no longer have to pay cause the tech does it better. Darwinism theory is in there somewhere. The guy said ""It is not the strongest of the species that survives, not the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change"" and I just heed those words. Nothing is forever. Even those actively changing the world are not in control on how it changes. So adapting to the change even if you don't like it is the way you gotta go or stay stuck in the past. Like them people The Sentinelese who are an uncontacted tribe living on North Sentinel Island. Back when tribes were a modern thing it would be ok. But now....like today....That would suck to be born there in modern times. I have been having soo much fun with all these new AI tools.",0

2293,"Nice episode bro, thanks for that!

Music is very interesting topic for me personally as well and I don't think AI will ever replace humans in arts. At least never completely. It will indeed make our life much easier and faster replacing sort of ""low level art"" like making a simple thumbnails, some basic scoring to games or amthospheres, but it wont replace the real thing composed/drawn or created by humans. In the end AI can only COPY, but can never CREATE. Yes it copies us extremely well but still, just a mimicking the stuff its been trained on.

And in future the real music composed by talented guys will become even more valuable in the realm of thousands AI created counterfits. I guess we can all agree that there's a big difference between simple loops/bits we may want to feel certain background with, and the moment you go for a concert to hear a real perfomance. The same applies to any arts, IMHO. So while AI will definitely replace some basic, ""low level art"", the real art people enjoy will only increase in value , as it become more scarse in comparison to the mirriads of AI generated crap. 

Mimicking music and human voices for sure will be the hardest, cuz we just got so used to it from evolutionary standpoint, and every time I hear AI generated voice I am about to vomit.  I may be picky, but to my ears even lots of modern human created music sound +- the same, so what to say about AI generated. Quite dull and insriping from the purely artiscit pesprtive, but extremely useful and exciting in terms of increasing humans productivity.

At the moment, AI is not what most people think it is.  It is a just an incredibly effective pattern matching and mashup system.  One could argue that our brains are not much more than that anyway.

On top of that, current AI is in its infancy.

AI will at some point replace all of us in all forms of labor due to how much we will cost compared to how much AI controlled machines will cost.  Who owns that will own all.  That is the future reality.  This is why the large AI ""houses"" are talking about the dangers of AI while moving as fast as they can into more powerful AI.

There is a threshold which will be crossed where the cost of machines building and designing machines is far better than people doing such.  At this point AI and machines will replace us all in the ""cost-effective"" utilization of employment.

What I mean by that is rather then starting with the quality of the out put of the AI should we be developing the ability to learn by the AI. So we can feed an AI a bunch of classical music and get an out put that sounds like classical music. But what if we want music made on a wash board? How many wash board music samples do we need to feed it to get an out put in that same style?

My thought with this is a way to move past the copy wright infringement idea of what we train AI on. While also making the AI tool a little more use focused. So if we have an AI that is very capable of learning say we only need to feed it 10 samples of washboard music of our own making before it will start matching our out put. It was trained on our own creation so it wont violate copyright laws meaning we can use it for how we want.

My personal reason for wondering this is that I am a small time webcomic artist and I would love to use AI to generate background assess such as people and houses.

By 2001 the sampling technology had progressed to the point where Disney stopped using orchestras for their TV series. Even so the technology was such that Orchestration for live players and Synthestration for samples in a MIDI studio were two different ‚Äòarts‚Äô or processes. That started to change when VSL came in the scene and you could, to a large extent, orchestrate for samples the way that you orchestrated for a live ensemble. Today sampling technology is so good that even when live orchestras are used in film, the samples often remain in the final mix.

AI will soon be trained on content made by the previous generation of AI and then, the next one will be trained by the previous too. In the end, we will end up with an infinite amount of AI generated content impossible to distinguish from a the tiny amount of human made content. When you print a photo and you photocopy the said photo iteratively many times using the previous copy, you end up with a low quality picture that doesn't look like the shot made by the photographer at the beginning. Maybe it will be the opposite and AI will simplify information sharing and help us focus on more complex tasks where human intelligence is needed.

2411,"So I can't play a musical instrument, but I love music creation software. Where I see AI's benefit is in the ability for me to have AI generate that guitar riff you played and then built around. I understand music theory and how music works. I can read sheet music and was in a variety of choirs over the years. Likewise, if I had an idea for something grandiose in an edm song that started off with bombastic orchestration, instead of paying a whole orchestra out of pocket with money i don't have, I can actually just have AI generate a couple for me and I sift through and modify what I want. The use of the tool to increase accessibility for the creation of art is there. It allows someone like me with crippling adhd who can't focus to learn how to play a piano, guitar, violin, etc, but can spend hours in front of a computer and a controller working with beats, compressions, and samples a wider ability of adding depth to the music creation process. That being said, I also am worried of the potential of the loss of the human element entirely. Art theory runs into a lot of problems if we lose touch with the humanity of art we lose touch with our connection to history as it is that art which gives us the window into the past whether through paintings, architecture, literature, theater, or my personal favorite music.

I also kinda feel like AI is currently most useful when it's integrated into the creation tools and helps with removing pain points.

Like I've gotten the most utility out of github copilot. It won't figure it how to implement the features i want to add. But it will make the more tedious bits a lot easier. It will auto complete lines of code based on previous ones. Like i write the first declaration and instead of copy paste and edit...i just basically tab the rest into existence.

And it remembers language conventions and stuff that I'd normally have to Google... And often struggle to find the answers. 

It doesn't really replace me as a programmer... It just reduces the friction and obstacles that made it hard to keep working on stuff... I still got a wall and can't really focus on projects for a while.... But it's made it easier to keep going and even to get started again....

I also have a bit of a problem with established artists saying, ""We don't want this -- get rid of it"".

AI opens up the door to SO many things we can do, but we haven't properly stopped and asked ourselves, ""Is this how we want to do things?"" It's only a go-go-go mentality based on ""because we can!"" AI presents the opportunity to bring advancements to so many fields and for that I am generally excited, but all I can see is how easily this new found power can be abused.

No, I don't mean people won't be able to make music on their own and enjoy it. But clearly being able to have a livable income is going to be extremely difficult, more than ever.  Rick Beato for example is going to be fine. He already has his wealth. The youngest Gen Z and/or maybe starting at Gen Alpha will likely never be able to make a living off their creative efforts; if those who are successful now are in few numbers, then their numbers will be fractions of it, to the point no one will think it's viable; except maybe the ultra wealthy and technocrats that own the machines, the technology and/or have the money to push their child to a spotlight. If it's 1% now out of the population, it'll be 0.1% for them, in my opinion. But people like Rick Beato, even if they act nice and cool, don't really care because they're set in life already, so are many other people. They''ll never have to struggle for food, a roof over their head or the ability to just exist regardless of what AI does because they're already on a financially secure path and have been, have had the headstart, have the money sitting around, etc.  All this stuff is extremely fun and cool if you completely and utterly ignore the reality of what it takes to live in the real world....income....money.

the AI fatigue you mentioned in this bit makes me think of this episode of Star Trek Voyager with The Doctor where he explores his love of opera with this alien species the crew comes across.

I think he refuses and the aliens make a copy of him that does what they want. does a farewell performance that's super soulful that barely gets a reaction from the aliens, but when they bring out the clone, he sings in the weird cut up all over the place version that takes away a lot and they go crazy for it. but i think it doesn't have any meaning to it or something like that.

Also, there are many other types of music, that lives on the fringes today, where performance maybe is much more valued and will be moving forward.

The US government began paying academics large sums to develop airplanes.
Two brother bicycle shop owners curiously follow efforts at human flight.
Somehow they are bitten by the flight bug and they decide to do their own experiments.
They realize they need a good site for testing kites and set up a test camp about 700 miles from home.
They build and ship man sized kites and gliders, test them and realize they have a long way to go.
After their 1901 test season Wilbur says: ‚ÄúNot within a thousand years will man ever fly‚Äù.
Meanwhile they decide to go completely back to basics and develop their own basic data rather than rely on published data.
They work the numbers.
They build new theoretical models.
They develop methods for flight control.
They build gorgeous gliders from scratch and test them again.
In 1902 they know that it is now down to finding the right power source.
With crucial help of their own shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, they build their own engine that beats all power to weight ratios of their time.
They build a much larger airplane that is truly clever in all its details.
They design and build two beautiful propellers.
They ship the whole thing back to their test site.

Faster clock speed means there's less low-losses time between switching, and more high-losses active time.

A band is not the same as a shell. A shell is what you get if you have more-or-less isolated atoms (or molecules), like in a gas or a liquid. A band is what you get in denser materials such as crystals, and it's a collective thing involving the entire structure of the material. A shell only allows one energy (e.g. the ground state of the hydrogen atom has an energy of -13.6 eV, take it or leave it), but a band allows a whole _range_ of energies, which secretly are like lots of little shells extremely close together, and shared across the entire material.",1

‚Ä¢	Material Properties: Graphite‚Äôs layered crystalline structure offers high thermal conductivity and electron mobility but complicates deposition and patterning processes necessary for semiconductor manufacturing. Its anisotropic properties also create variability in circuit performance.
	‚Ä¢	Manufacturing Compatibility: Standard semiconductor production facilities are optimized for silicon, not graphite. Modifying these facilities to accommodate graphite‚Äôs unique requirements involves significant technological and financial challenges.
	‚Ä¢	Process Adaptation: Conventional etching and chemical processes used for silicon are ineffective with graphite, necessitating the development of new methods specific to graphite.
	‚Ä¢	Environmental Sensitivity: Graphite processors require strict environmental controls during manufacturing due to their sensitivity to humidity and temperature, adding complexity and cost to the production process.
	‚Ä¢	Scale Challenges: These technical and operational complexities make scaling up graphite processor production both technically demanding and economically costly, limiting widespread adoption.",1

*_Several techniques can be employed to induce bandgaps in graphene:_*

	_1. Chemical Functionalization: By attaching functional groups or molecules to graphene, the electronic properties can be altered, introducing bandgaps. This method offers tunable bandgap widths but may suffer from stability issues._
	_2.Graphene Nanoribbon Formation: Narrow strips of graphene, known as nanoribbons, naturally exhibit bandgaps due to quantum confinement effects. By precisely controlling the width and edge structure of nanoribbons, the bandgap width can be tailored._
	_3.Strain Engineering: Applying mechanical strain to graphene can modify its electronic properties, including inducing bandgaps. This approach offers a reversible method for controlling conductivity but requires precise manipulation._

*Implementing in Transistors*

*_To utilize graphene as a semiconductor in transistors:_*

	_Fabrication: Begin with a graphene layer on a substrate, typically silicon dioxide._
	_Bandgap Introduction: Employ one of the aforementioned techniques to introduce bandgaps into graphene._
	_Electrode Integration: Add source and drain electrodes to facilitate electron flow._
	_Gate Control: Utilize a gate electrode to modulate the conductivity of graphene by adjusting the bandgap width._",1

The novel material is _not_ actually graphene (a semi-metal), but the eponymous SEG, which is a monolayer chemically bonded to a SiC (silicon carbide) substrate; this bonding appears to be at the root of SEG being a semiconductor. 
The bandgap is measured at about 0.6 eV, which sets it apart from graphene. The material is doped, remarkably, with O_2 and features a mobilities of ca. 5000 cm^2/Vs, which is considered remarkable. 
The authors exhibit a FET fabricated with SEG as the channel material; it features an on/off ratio of ~10^4.

3428,"Back when mobile phones had cameras so worthless that you carried a real camera with you around. Or maybe even future back when mobile phones where going from something you talked into turning instead towards being a SMS device. Back then phones lasted days without needing to be charged.

When you open the camera app on a smartphone to this day, everything in the background usually have to be paused to prosses the image capture of 50mp or more sensors. Not one camera/sensor. But multiple. Even if overnight our chips are 10x faster or 10x more energy efficient? Maybe both at the same time even? So what?
If I take up my Android phone and aim the camera at food. The phone tells me it is food. If I aim the camera at text? It tells me it is text. Rather then longing for a 10x something. Why not question WTF our devices are doing. And note. It is not YOUR device. It is a lie to call it ours even. Considering that phone calls are mostly spam or nothing relevant to anyone anymore? Why not park the devices from communicating to towers 24/7. Why not turn off automatic notifications pinning painstakingly for updates? Even if your phone took 10min brakes between checking if you have a new message sent from friends and family? Would it really hinder your life? Or maybe it would help it. Smartphones are a amazing tool and it is humbling to take out a midrange phone and snap a image with resolutions and clarity that would be considered infeasible to do 20-30-40 years ago. (without the most professional of equipment that is.)

It is also very strange to take a 10+ old computer and throw what in reality is a quite bloated Linux image (like say Linux Mint.) and have a machine so screaming fast and lean to question why anyone needs anything more then that. It is incredible to even have 2! cores of compute power! A single core CPU and 2GB of ram is more then enough. Twice that? It is luxury.

Outside of playing games and AI whatever whatever. The modern computers we have today are fast enough. A mobile phone with todays tech + some more sensible decisions made? That alone is going to give everyone that wants it a 10x faster, 10x more power saving, 10x longer lasting. Tool.

Instead companies are going to 10x downsize the battery size, 10x the price, and to top it off 10x the infeasibility of the thing lasting more then 4years.",0

There is a massive difference between a technology being introduced in an academic journal based on controlled, small-scale lab experiments, and it actually finding real-world success. ""Paradigm shift"" generating technologies are constantly being announced, yet only a tiny fraction ever hold up to their promise. The fact that these researchers are not being bankrolled by microchip manufacturers also makes me suspect industry players are sceptical of this technology. Finally, without trying to stoke sinophobia, I would note that all researchers on this project were based at Chinese institutions, which have a *very* strong geopolitical motivation to overpromise regarding alternatives to silicon-based microchips.

here are some conclusions in comparison with standard IGBT Moduls (although I obviosly can only talk about powerelectronic side, not microelectronics)
- If they die (explode) they do so pretty quite, that's nice. They also don't push the silicon everywhere. I tell you, cleaning a cabinet where a IGBT did explode is annoying...
- They are faster. witch IGBTs our switchingfrequency was at (depending on the output current) 2...10 kHz, with SiC we are usually at 12...20 kHz with comparable current. That reduces the losses in the chokes significantly, and reduces the noice by far. Sadly it seems, that the chokes are now at their limit. even if the output current of the Semiconductors could be increased, there are no chokes to smoothe the current out. with 25 kHz most choke technologies are also already at the optimum with copper and iron losses.
- They survive overvoltages longer/easier.
- they get extreamly hot, therefore the chip is a lot closer to the baseplate (wich is attached to a heat sink. sadly this increases the parasitic capasity, and because of that also EMC noise against PE. It easily interferes with other devices. An EMC Filter is mostly required.
- because of the higher switching frequency parasitic problems have gone up a notch as well. For example: we build a bidirectional, galvanically isolated DC//DC converter. In the lab it worked with 30 kHz, but when we build it in a cabinet, we had to reduce the switching frequency to 17 kHz, just because the cables were a few centimeters longer, and therefore the parasitic inductance inceased. The difference is, again, the lab compared to a real application.
- they are, at least for now, still very expansive

I‚Äôve been saying since 2013 that it seems extremely (Occam's Razor) obvious that all electrons and all photons are in orbit with a dark matter particle and I‚Äôve shared my theory literally many thousands of times with hundreds of the world‚Äôs top physics universities, professors, labs, channels, etc.

Based on Fermilab, CERN and other recent findings, I now more specifically think electrons are made of an electron neutrino entangled in orbit with a dark matter muon neutrino, explaining their erratic orbits around nuclei, superposition, uncertainty, the double slit, etc just like I‚Äôve been saying since 2013.  And I think when the electron neutrino gets entangled with the muon neutrino it creates the Higgs field.

I think when an electron gets a 2nd muon neutrino, it‚Äôs what we call a Tau particle and I think photons are a pair of electrons entangled in orbit together in apparent axial or helical polarizable wave-like movement depending on the direction of their rotation as they travel.  This explains string theory, the double slit experiment, uncertainty, superposition, etc and the speed of the rotation explains electromagnetic wavelengths.  It also explains ‚Äò‚Äôthe ultraviolet catastrophe‚Äô‚Äô with the separation of the electron and muon neutrinos due to the higher energy.

I also think protons and neutrons are actually made up of over 1,800 electrons with the muon neutrinos likely all clustered in the center surrounded by the same number of electron neutrinos.

However a CPU needs literally billions of transistors not just switching quickly, but in a long sequence WITHIN a single clock cycle to do any computing. Thats why they run much slower than these RF transistors. 
Guess what: Fast switches have been around for much longer than that too: Vacuum tubes that run in the 100s of GHz have been around for over 50 years, yet noone builds computers with those anymore for some reason. Oh yeah, because they cant be built into nanometer-scale somehow. Which is just as much a challenge for graphene btw.

3811,"# Proposing a Solution to the Bandgap Problem in Graphene for Transistor Applications

**Author:** Arceneaux
**Date:** 04/22/2024

## Abstract
Graphene's high electron mobility, thinness, and flexibility make it an attractive material for use in advanced transistors. However, its lack of a natural bandgap presents a significant challenge for its application in digital electronics. This paper proposes a novel approach to introducing a bandgap in graphene, enabling its use in transistors and paving the way for graphene-based computers. The proposed solution involves a combination of chemical doping, strain engineering, and graphene nanoribbons to create a stable and tunable bandgap.

## Introduction
Graphene is a two-dimensional material composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. It exhibits exceptional electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties, which have attracted significant interest in its use for electronic applications. Despite its high electron mobility and flexibility, graphene's lack of a bandgap has limited its utility in digital electronics, where a bandgap is essential for turning transistors on and off.

The goal of this paper is to propose a solution to the bandgap problem in graphene, enabling the creation of graphene transistors for use in electronic devices.

## Challenges with Bandgap in Graphene
Graphene's electronic properties result from its unique band structure, with a linear dispersion relation around the Dirac points. This structure means that graphene has no natural bandgap, which is a significant hurdle for creating transistors and other digital electronic components.

Previous approaches to introducing a bandgap in graphene include chemical doping, strain engineering, and the use of graphene nanoribbons. While these approaches have shown promise, each has limitations in terms of scalability, stability, or tunability.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution aims to create a stable and tunable bandgap in graphene by combining three approaches: chemical doping, strain engineering, and graphene nanoribbons.

### 1. Chemical Doping
Chemical doping involves introducing impurities into the graphene lattice to modify its electronic properties. This method can create a bandgap, but maintaining stability and uniformity in the bandgap remains a challenge. The proposed solution uses targeted chemical doping to introduce a controlled number of impurities, providing a tunable bandgap while preserving the electronic properties of graphene.

### 2. Strain Engineering
Strain engineering involves applying mechanical strain to graphene to alter its electronic structure. This approach can create a bandgap by deforming the lattice, changing the dispersion relation at the Dirac points. The proposed solution incorporates strain engineering to enhance the effect of chemical doping, allowing for finer control over the bandgap.

### 3. Graphene Nanoribbons
Graphene nanoribbons are narrow strips of graphene that exhibit a bandgap due to quantum confinement effects. The proposed solution uses graphene nanoribbons to define specific regions within a larger graphene sheet, creating bandgaps in these areas. This method allows for precise control over the bandgap's size and location, enabling the creation of complex electronic circuits.

## Implementation and Applications
The proposed solution can be implemented through a combination of fabrication techniques, including chemical vapor deposition, lithography, and strain control mechanisms. By integrating these approaches, it is possible to create graphene transistors with stable and tunable bandgaps.

The primary application of this solution is in the creation of graphene-based transistors, which can be used in various electronic devices, including high-speed processors, flexible electronics, and low-energy components. This development could pave the way for graphene-based computers, offering significant advantages in terms of speed, energy efficiency, and flexibility.

## Conclusion
This paper proposes a novel solution to the bandgap problem in graphene, combining chemical doping, strain engineering, and graphene nanoribbons to create a stable and tunable bandgap. The proposed approach offers a path toward graphene-based transistors and ultimately graphene-based computers. Future research should focus on refining these techniques, improving scalability, and exploring additional applications for graphene in electronic devices.",0

3961,"Keep in mind, when they talk about ""tech layoffs"" as a result of AI, they're not replacing software engineers with AI that can code. The technology is just not there yet. 

There ARE some roles in tech (but not software engineering) that are actually being replaced and their workers laid off, but for the most part, when software engineers are laid off it's because upper management is pushing product owners to swap out planned features in favor of AI initiatives. That new roadmap needs additional headcount (AI engineers / Data Scientists). Since mass-hiring new roles is frowned upon by investors in the current economic market, some companies are laying off Software Engineers to make room in their budget to hire AI engineers. 

In other cases, these Software Engineers ARE actually replaced with AI. Where AI stands for ""Associates in India"" as others have pointed out. It's important to note, however, that to a company, an inexpensive replacement worker is seen as a commodity rather than an investment. With less resources, these workers are churned through, burnt out, and offered far less support than more expensive Western workers.

And as a comment on this video, AI is definitely being over hyped. That is causing the public to feel a lot of unnecessary fear and confusion. So many companies are popping up with products that are far from being ready and are full of bugs. Some are having paying customers act as beta testers. Customer service is extremely poor and when you ask a question, they don't have an answer, claiming they don't actually understand how their products do what they do because ""AI is a mystery"" according to one response. Another I heard was, ""You have to understand that this is a small company with few employees."". And when I see news about it, they have a partnership with Microsoft, $1.4 million in investments and have a company valuation of $6 million. These companies open Discord servers and have their paying customers ""play"" with the service while monitoring the comments to see what might be working. To me, that's shameful and possibly a symptom of the new ""AI business model"", which in my opinion is terrible. That's one reason I think that this is a bubble likely to burst.

If your country has suffocating taxes and regulations - you gonna have problems. Big players will remain, but new will emerge very slowly, because state has imposed increased entry barrier upon them.
If you are living in a good place, where there government intervention is minimal, where minimum wage is not too high, and taxes are low - you can expect a wave of new companies, that will see AI tech as facilitator , which allows them to overcome entry barrier easier. 

Previously, if you wanted to try certain new business idea, you had to, let say, hire at least 10 ppl. Which is expensive ofc, and requires significant starting capital. This could make it ""not worth it"" situation. 
Now you can open the same business with 5 ppl. But you gonna open it nevertheless. And create those 5 jobs. 

If anything, you should look at your local taxes and regulations, and see, whether they are new business friendly or not. This is the best indicator whether you will have more jobs or less jobs at the end of the day, when dust settles.

During interviews all of the technology developers of the time said, paraphrasing, ""Majority of jobs will be automated. How society reacts, we don't know. Don't dismiss the lack of capability of this emerging technology, computers were mocked. Now, look where we are; many are vying for degrees in computing and many jobs require some skill with a computer.""¬†

The problem with computing, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and robotics; there will be very little replacement jobs, because those jobs to care for those maturing and emerging technology will be nearly automated. At this moment, there are fully or nearly completely automated manufacturing plants where few engineers maintain the whole facility. Add automation to design, transportation, and retailing, you've eliminated more than three quarters of all current jobs as they exist right now!

If you're unskilled and lack ambition to adapt to the coming reality, you will suffer. Your only hope will be government assistance, but considering many won't have a job, therefore can't pay taxes, government assistance likely won't exist.

AI is great for making images/video clips--but not much so far you'd want to or can sell since everyone is in on it, and some things like proofing software as it's better at that than humans.  I'm concerned about the proliferation of deep fakes, but for actual use it seems more like taking a Google search and summarizing it.  What are good stocks to invest in? It doesn't analyze sources and draw a conclusion, just parrots what a selected website says.  What is the trend in voting in my state? Same thing, just matches on my keywords and finds a matching answer.  In particular AI shows the biases of it's programmers, as when Google's Gemini erased white people and especially white males from image.  Seriously, in it's world there are Hispanics, Native Americans, Blacks, and South Asians (Indians).  Cues from medieval knights to Romans brought back mostly minorities.

4250,"If you haven't noticed, our ongoing AGE OF TRIVIA in the 1st World is dominated by MANIPULATION by way of MARKETING. Everything possible gets marketed from goods to politics. There is no actual ""Artificial Intelligence"", despite the marketing hype. It's complex programming that collects data into its database, traverses that database and outputs collected data that approximates what the user has requested. The proper name is EXPERT SYSTEM. (I'd post a link about Expert Systems, but YouTube hates links that aren't to itself.) What's new right now is having advanced Expert Systems improved collection of data to put in its database and more elaborate comprehension and resolution of requests for answers. Throw on top the recently matured speech recognition and text-to-speech technology and it all sounds super GEE WHIZ! But there is zero actual intelligence. It does have some behavior similar to parrots and monkeys in that it can sound like it's having an actual conversation by way of collecting information about the person interacting with it then altering its output to imitate that person. I call it Monkey-See-Monkey-Do (as of circa 1995). It's the prime reason ""AI"" systems that interact with people literally reboot, dumping their current cache, so as to not KEEP the characteristics of those with whom they've interacted. It is dirt easy to ""train"" systems that don't reboot to exhibit any behavior the user likes. Infamously, older ""AI"" systems have been taught by random users from the public to be hateful, bigoted, obscene and evil in general. I once ""trained"" an AI to plot to murder its programmer. Needless to say, such systems never pass any sort of Turing Test for intelligence. AI is incredibly complicated with variations and refinements that make it good at one particular skill or another. But in no way is any of it ""intelligent"" relative to actual human intelligence. There is no Skynet. And our ongoing Dark Age of Computing ensures that if there was a Skynet, it would be hackable. Coding/programming remains a fragile process whereby any complex project is going to have significant security holes. And so far, ""AI"" not only has those security holes, but it is incapable of understanding and help prevent those security holes. For now, so much for AI being able to program itself or help we humans program better. Stay tuned.",0

Is there a bubble, and are people going to lose money? Almost certainly yes. Nvidia are making hay while the sun shines. They're selling picks and shovels into the gold rush. Or picking up nickel's in front of a steam roller. Pick your metaphor. People are losing their jobs to AI, and the people most exposed are the Star performers. The research, because of course there is research, by Bryjolfsson I think. Shows that the people who benefit from AI, are the sub par to merely competent, who are boosted up to the range just below the Star performer. Meanwhile use of AI by Star performers slows them down, as it causes them to doubt and second guess their own judgement.

4316,"I've worked with the neural net technology way back in time over 30 years ago, and know that it's real enough. Back in time, no one was interested despite it being usable even on the weak CPU tech we had. I always disliked using ""AI"" to describe what's going on, it's more like a continuation of improvements with automation that's been underway for over a century. The jobs that are being replace, should in fact be replaced, because they are either relatively trivial to do, or take a lot of repetitious tasks to perform. The so-called ""AI"" is actually best described as the use of a technique known as ""gradient descent"", sometimes referred to as ""steepest descent"". although ""steepest"" is misleading because the steepest path is not always being taken. Gradient descent is the entire ""secret sauce"" to how the AI we hear about today, actually works, and it's very simple to understand. Gradient descent is what powers genetic evolution using DNA, and it powers many other processes that are ""not alive"" such as the unfolding progression taken by a landslide, it powers how humans learn over long periods of time, but importantly, not how we learn over very short periods of time, that's not yet understood how human intelligence works. You should think of what is called ""AI"", as more of a slow evolutionary process that's iterative over many generations, rather than something similar to what human brains are doing over very short periods of time. Gradient decent algorithms (there are many flavours of the algorithm) usually takes a very long time, due to process that occurs over many iterations, or generations, of small changes, and it requires sufficient amounts of quality data for the process to hone in on near optimal solutions. In contrast, the human brain will often take exponentially much less time, and exponentially much less information, to perform much more complex tasks, however gradient descent is still seen to be occurring over much longer periods of time. For example, ""learning by doing"" requires many iterations, over several generations of trail and error correction, over many nights of good sleep, for a skilled worker to become an expert at performing certain tasks. The AI of today, only solves on part of a very complex problem. The workers who will be replaced, will not be missed after a short period of time, however many other workers will not be replaced, instead they will use the new tools to become more efficient at doing the same jobs that they did before.",0

They don't think or anything, it's just a large matrix database that the models scan and provide relatively okay answers based on the user input and that's all they do. They don't think, they are not so much different than a regular SQL database and enough code functions to execute and call data in order. For example I made a chatbot to answer simple questions in the front end with javascript based on simple if else statements and then I wrote a back end algorithm with a couple different logic statements and a lot of regex functions to detect if user has entered a specific text or a zipcode, based on each word, it goes thru the database and changes the select query and returns the correct listing result the user is looking for. It first looks thru the hardcoded javascript if else statements with some simple regex functions and if there's a quick answer it can provide, it'll provide it, but if it doesn't find the answer, it will post the user input to the backend and then go thru the logic diagram and then generate the sql query to run and post a response back to the user. That is definitely not an AI but it's not so much different than the companies who try to sell their supposed ""AI Chatbots"". They claim to have an AI but then they request us to convert our data into Json format and post them to that and the best result I got from there so called AI was absolutely very similar to what I have coded which is extremely disappointing. So yeah I think most of those companies are basically running a scam and lying about their capabilities. Most of them don't have an AI but rather a hard biased bot just like the one I developed and that's basically it.",0

A classic one (which is actually AI) would be the call center AI's that take your name and account number. Likely these get your details up on the screen of the agent when you speak to them, likely cutting a minute of say an average 8min conversation. This means something like a 13% efficiency in call throughput for agents available, meaning it's possible to cut 13% of staff from that section.  This is a fairly extreme example though.

4544,"14:06 to 14:36 - THIS is the reality.

It's not just ""going to happen"", it already has happened...

2 or 3 decades ago there were loads of jobs for simple tasks like office juniors, filing, typing, receptionists, etc; as computers and technology worked their way into the digital age, almost all these starter / low-paid jobs are being replaced by computers.  Where you used to have 10+ staff at a supermarket checkout, now you have computers (self-scan / self-checkouts) with just 3 staff overseeing everything and assisting where required.  Where you used to need 200 people on a manufacturing line or warehouse, now you need 50 people plus robots.  

AI is just an extension, the next step, of what is already happening and has been for decades.

Ever since the first calculator, computers were better than humans at certain things.  The ratio of what humans are capable of / better at than computers vs what computers are capable of / better at than humans has been very slowly and gradually over more than half a century been sliding from one end of the scale towards the other ever since their inception.  And of course the number of jobs that computers do vs the number of jobs that require humans has reflected that as it also gradually slides from one end to the other.

But don't forget that jobs are just a means to an end, they're not the end itself.  The end is productivity.  Nobody needs jobs, if computers can do all the work for us.  The real problem is that jobs have served as a way of balancing human selfishness, the real challenge is finding a fair-ish way to distribute resources.... something that unfortunately humans are terrible at.

This is evident in the rise of young people pursuing social media content creators as a career.  What's happening is that the more jobs computers are doing, the less humans are required; the ""influencer"" trend is a reflection of us struggling with how to distribute resources in the absence of the requirement of real work.  It's starting to become almost like a popularity contest.  The more popular you are on social media, the bigger a slice of the pie you get, while computers (and the older generations for now) do most of the real work.

AI will ultimately replace humans at everything.  (Unless civilisation as we know it collapses before then.)  They're scalable, exchange skills and information better, can be bespoked better, and are easily replicated.  They have none of the restrictions that humans do.  Current AI shows promise, but is still a very early step compared to the billions of years it took life to get this far.  But unless we destroy ourselves, it will come.  Maybe sooner, maybe later but it will come.

They will also rule humans eventually.... and not by force like in the Terminator movies, it'll be by choice.  Look how terrible human politicians are, look how terrible corporations and their directors/CEOs are, look how terrible the courts and justice system are.  And look how easily people are influenced by propaganda... and then think about how good AI is at controlling and influencing people by ""the alogrithm"" - even before their ability to make their own content becomes indistinguishable from ours.  It's only a matter of time before people will voluntarily hand over almost all governance to computers, and while it might go horribly wrong, looking at humans' track record so far, it'll more likely be an improvement.",0

Fortunately, over time, people began to come to their senses, and we no longer subjected ourselves to those dreadful moving pictures that made us want to throw up.

Personally, I grew weary of the AI hype within a month. The term ""artificial"" inherently implies something not real, and the data produced by AI originates from humans and is crafted by humans. Therefore, I fail to see why it should be idolized. It's particularly irksome when self-proclaimed experts attempt to monetize teaching AI, especially considering that some made these claims mere hours after the release of ChatGPT, indicating they couldn't possibly have more experience than any other user.

Regrettably, the label ""AI"" is beginning to resemble the similarly overhyped label ""superfood"" on ""health"" foods‚Äîa term that doesn't always carry significant weight.

4630,"I find it funny that people are shocked that AI could replace jobs. Machines have been replacing labour since the early 1900s Industrial age. Think of all those factory and farm workers that lost their jobs when machines could do the job much faster and cheaper. What about all the horse breeders  and cart makers when cars were invented.  Not to mention all the handmade craft makers when the factories could mass produce. But if anything machines replacing labour allowed the poor children an education because they weren't needed to work. Now we think its shocking to make a young child work long days in dangerous jobs, but at the time many protested as they thought they needed the income their children's jobs provided. The fact they are working on machines that can be trained to do anything we can teach it isn't a surprise, its a natural development in industry.

And a few AI experts have warned it could lead to mass unemployment. That is why they talk about the Universal Credit Benefit. Because AI can be trained to do anything we can do. While it takes longer to train an AI than a human worker, once trained it is able to work 24/7 without any breaks. Of course business is always looking for ways to increase productivity and profits. 

However, to be fair they have been working on AI for decades,  that is how we got the computer. Remember when people worried that the computer itself would cause mass unemployment when first release. As its able to do a lot of the jobs of a secretary and worried because that was one of the few jobs women were allowed to do. And how people feared the internet would replace teachers, why would you need a teacher when you can look everything up online. And to be fair you can but most still value human teachers and classroom teaching experiences. While the internet has replaced a lot of the high street shops, it has also provided more with different employment. 

Humans will adapt and even if all businesses replace workers with AI bots, we will find other stuff to do. I'm guessing future generations will look back and be shocked that people used to spend so much of their time working. Just we look back and shocked that child labour was normal.",0

4843,"Great video and some thorough research. However, the critical lesson in all of this is that our journey with AI really mirrors us. It's a reflection of the darker sides of human civilisation and a reminder that we are a young species, still learning from significant challenges and mistakes.

Imagine, if you will, a parent guiding their child through the trials of growing up. Initially, the child stumbles, falls, makes mistakes, but with each lesson, they grow a bit wiser, a bit more capable. In a similar vein, our society is maturing in its use of technology. One day, we might evolve to a point where we have saved our planet and established a system of governance that garners universal respect‚Äîa society where citizens no longer have concerns about Data Brokers, Robo Callers, Scammers, Fraudsters, or any form of criminality.

This might sound like a distant dream in 2024, but just as a parent holds hope that their child will one day mature into a wise adult, so too can we hold hope for our future society. The current incarnation of our species may indeed need a complete rewiring, but if history teaches us anything, it's that change is not only possible, it is inevitable.

Your episode brilliantly highlights that AI, much like a young child, holds immense potential, yet it requires guidance, ethical frameworks, and careful nurturing. The truth about AI lies somewhere between revolutionary and overhyped, much like how the reality of parenting isn't just about the milestones, but also the messy, everyday challenges that are seldom discussed.

When we start using it to analyse medical images, design critical systems and do other things that have traditionally required real, demonstrable human understanding and judgement that extend beyond merely performing the task itself, then we risk losing that expertise and handing over responsibility to what is little more than a clever parrot.

The impact to current employment levels, and specifically staffing cuts is interesting, albeit a little speculative. Am not buying into this is because of AI just yet. Maybe some companies are anticipating a greater level of productivity...that would be a leap imo.

Example - Microsoft laid off 10,000 in the last 6 months, and roughly 2000 of these were in the gaming division. Is this AI? Probably not, probably more a consequence of their Activision acquisition. Activision employed some 13,000 employees prior to the Microsoft transaction, so in real terms this is a net gain for MS not a net loss.

Here is a table of MS global employment levels.

2023 was 221,000, a 0% decline from 2022.
2022 was 221,000, a 22.1% increase from 2021.
2021 was 181,000, a 11.04% increase from 2020.
2020 was 163,000, a 13.19% increase from 2019.
  
So from preCOVID to peak of 2023 there is a delta of 58,000 employees. Have MS laid off this many? No. Perhaps another explanation, therefore, is this is still companies adjusting post COVID. 

Companies make decisions, and sometimes these decisions impact employment. Suspect Amazon and Google are slowly realising that some of their speculative gadgets are not generating any money e.g. Alexa devices, and so are looking to downsize, and potentially exit. AI related? A bit of a stretch. Normal cycle related? More likely, plus some residual impacts of post COVID.",0

Less compute typically correlates to less useful responses. Enshitification, just like everything else. Your inquiries are also being diluted by all of the safety guardrails put in place as well. No one wants to be liable. When GPT4 was released its responses were quite good in comparison to what they are now. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was still very limited but I‚Äôve found it very useful in some remedial and tedious tasks.

You can get chat GPT to spit out lyrics of various songs using key words, and phrases from various websites. The only reason it is viable for these companies is due to all the work of others they are taking, and hoping they can displace them fast enough before regulations and fines catch up to what has happened. 
If they actually paid for the work they are taking, it wouldn't be even remotely profitable to run these systems (not that they currently are profitable in most cases).

And because they did it for like 20 years, they were able to type like 200 words per minute to 400 words per minute. So they were easily able to read and answer ChatGPT, because their reading typically is caused by a digital machine that lets them read faster than a normal human does and type faster than a normal human does, because of their machinery and the fact that they've been doing it their whole lives. And there are adult humans who are intelligent just trapped in a body that's incapable of a high physical capacity outside of the exercise they were doing.

Some decades ago for a time the market though conglomerates and consolidations were great and prices got up, then the reverse happened companies that spinned off companies and became more focused on their core competences were better.

Part of my research is working with large language models like GPT4 and they are horrible at the tasks people want to use them for. Even tasks like translating natural language into a format a computer use or vice versa, which I know a bunch of people want to use them for, LLMs actually perform poorly on these tasks. They are stochastic parrots: they know how to sound correct but there is very little substance underneath them. It pisses me off that this is what people call AI right now. 

The fact transformers are even used for this task was an accident. They trained a model and realized that it sounded like it could answer questions somewhat correctly so that is the direction people have decided to take. Modern machine learning as a whole isn't even such a solid science. The papers are mostly ""we tried a thing and empirically it did better. We don't know why it did better"". Compare that to the actual AI field where we are working on guarantees and actual planning. However, now we have to get the question ""why not use a transformer to solve this problem?""",0

The reality is that the ""great AI change"" has not resulted in profits in companies that paid billions to companies like NV, Intel and IBM over 4 yrs ago. Around then over $6T was begining to be pumped into the ""next"" AI revolution. And much like so many other Segways, AI since its big climb two years ago has actually provided very little _actual_ benefit in companies - Im not sure where you are getting data that it has. 
What has happened, is the global economy has ground to a halt, and these tech companies have dropped jobs to keep the AI investors happy (because its so much cash involved). And this is the problem, this is running on borrowed time. Unless there are direct usable outcomes that directly help companies _make_ money (remember the profits you noted, were _because_ they shed workforces - look at their R&D writeoffs to understand the problem). 
Imho.. this deflation of AI and tech overall has been a problem waiting to happen. We have seen so many tech BS fads in the last 10-15 yrs. From VR, AR, XR, 3D TVs, 3D printing, and so on, all set to ""revolutionize industries"" and they really havent - theyve made their own little niche industries, but fundamentally, they are YO-YO's at best. Short entertainment trash products.
AI is in the same domain, until there are legitmate, valid business use cases that are reliable and actually make the business money - most AI solutions (just because it has AI in its name) cost _far_ more than a traditional solution, so the idea AI is _helping_ is a false economy, quite literally. 
In the end, its business FOMO. Thinking that missing out on the AI wave.. stops them making money/sales. This is actually starting to turn people off - people see an AI chatbot, and they close it almost immediately these days. Which is funny, because we had good AI chatbots 20 yrs ago, again, we arent solving a problem, we are just following a fad. Once it fades.. this is a _massive_ economic crash that will hurt everyone because of the scale of investment that has already happened. We make a few companies and people _extremely_ rich and now, they will bail, and everyone else will be left holding the debt.",1

Or why not the evolution itself or its own, at the end of everything, reality that could or could not work?, Investigating the AGI even if its bases are to execute many orders, when the complexity reaches a certain level it is no longer possible treat them as a normal program, the size of the largest local models that I have downloaded on my computers and devices take up several applications or even more RAM than some operating systems,and the largest ones take up dozens of times more than an operating system and other programs and are huge networks that predict probabilities with properties mathematically enclosed in binary boolen circuits,that exist naturally in thermodynamic things such as diffusion, cross-entropy, probability distribution, synapses and electrochemical processes in our brain...But for example Classical computers could not simulate the quantum mechanics of the brain if the transistors consider it noise, nor with electricity as information because it can only be worth one or zero,The number pi does not exist in classical hardware, but the temperature is real and can be valid as any other irrational number, and in reality that causes them to waste so much energy, transistors do not They take advantage of the noise, they remove it and that wastes them, causing them to store very little information, on the other hand, a single molecule has thousands of trillions of classical configurations in itself and they find a good way,photons have different lengths, the temperature of a material is not exact in reality and can have practically irrational values, that approximation that exists and spends little is the key of real AGI,follow a similar or alternative path with different compounds that takes you using the infinite to continuous or ""real"" intelligence, instead of determinable abstract processes.",0

5318,"The biggest problem today is that the phrase ""AI"" means everything and nothing. In this very video the phrase is used to reference large-language models (like ChatGPT) and Google's narrow-scope ""chemical engineering"" model. Moreover, terms like ""generative"" are absurd.

Numerous rigorous studies have found that these ""generative"" AIs are actually ""degenerative,"" as their accuracy rates (hovering around 50% early-on) are now under 10%, under 5% in numerous cases. That is a massive crash in accuracy rate spanning just about eight months. We have observed this first-hand in our own company as we were testing AIs for producing code, making SQL queries more efficient, etc. At this point, the big players are almost useless for these functions, as they perpetually generate code that is not runnable and SQL that is invalid or is less efficient than what any minimally competent human can produce. Particularly on the front of generating code, these models seem to prefer referencing functions that never have existed and presently do not exist in the target language. These functions are treated like ""black boxes"" where ""all the magic"" happens. In other words, rather than actually producing useful code, these models have declined to resorting to just ""making stuff up.""

When you get into areas outside of highly-structured data, such as natural-language processing itself, the decline is even more apparent. I have a Ph.D. in analytic philosophy, and my partner and I have spent significant time engaging with these ""AIs"" (now in scare quotes). The punting and outright laughable responses from these ""large-language models"" is EPIC! The idea that these ""AIs"" are ""general purpose,"" ""almost sentient"" thinkers is ludicrous. Musk is simply wrong on this point; there is nothing to fear from these ""AIs"" in the sense of pending sentience! The thing to fear is how completely people now absorb whatever nuttiness these large-language models produce; remember that they are literally degenerative.

Having watched the Superbowl and its Microsoft Copilot commercial, I seriously question how the US JD has not already filed actions against Microsoft. Perhaps it's just flagrant ignorance on their part, but that Copilot commercial is hype, false-promises, and fraud. Copilot can really do almost NOTHING of what the commercial claims. ""Write my next 3D video game."" Yeah, right! ALL it's going to do is (like a search engine) point you to a few web pages where you can start working with a game engine, like Unreal engine. That does NOT ""write your next 3D video game!"" ALL of the true creativity and ALL of the hard work remains undone once you select a 3D engine within which to write your next game. Start a business? LOL. Same absurdity. It goes on and on.

And, now Microsoft is playing the same anti-trust-violating games with Copilot that it played with IE. Again, where is the JD? But Microsoft would not be alone in getting indicted. The hype and fraud in ""AI"" today is beyond anything I've seen in my lifetime.

I could rant on and on here. But the summation of the matter is that narrow-scope AIs can increase productivity within that narrow scope. But those are not the same ""AIs"" that the public engages with! When we're talking about ""large language models,"" the ones that the public engages with, they are rapidly getting much, much less accurate and useful, literally ""degenerating"" rather than being more and more creative and ""self-learning."" They are better in highly-structured contexts, such as generating computer code, but even in that context, they are rapidly falling off. As general-purpose, ""almost sentient"" entities, they have become demonstrably laughable. These things are just glorified Eliza applications. And they are never, ever going to become ""smart"" or sentient!",1

This happens, when for example a company can now do more business with less energy. That company can then put the savings into growing the business and end up expanding beyond the original energy needs. But this time with more business to do. If we think of labor as energy, a rebound effect could occur after some time.

Another possibility is that AI starts to enable new forms of work that were previously impossible or not viable. I have found several AI tools that help with adapting to new challenges in our current world. Searching for information is now supercharged.

5414,"I don't think AI is displacing any significant number of jobs... Yet. Instead, I think there are a few other trends going on.
1) outsourcing traditionally employee positions to contractors. Especially in IT fields, this trend is catching like wildfire right now. Instead of hiring people on full time, setting up benefits, and all the rest, they are hiring people by contract for a more narrowly scoped project. And these contractors may be dedicated to one company, and move from project to project, but the companies save a lot of overhead with on and off boarding and benefits planning compared to firing people when a project completes. And they save a lot of money on idle employees who are between projects.
2) Interest rates being ""higher for longer"". Corporate loans are restructured and renegotiated every 3-24 months... And well... Here we are. Rates haven't dropped, and it doesn't look like they are going to drop significantly, so companies are slimming down to smaller profitable teams, and doing less r&d gambles on side projects. It isn't all gone... Just not as crazy like it was the last couple years when companies were hiring talent purely to keep talent away from competitors. When rates drop, we will see more employee gambling again, but this is why it has hit the tech sector and not employers across the board.
3) project ramp-down. Any large product rollout has a hiring blitz as a product is prepped for release... And then a dump. The apple car, meta's vr projects, a bunch of AI centric product rollout... I think that because so many things were delayed and restarted during the pandemic, the product cycle is just a bit more synced up than is typical, and a lot of projects have wrapped or closed in quick succession.

And I mean... I use AI... It makes everything worse still. Google and Bing have gotten awful over the last year compared to the results they gave before. But that AI is replacing algorithms, not people. Ups is rolling out AI, and it is replacing databases and software, not people. AI assistants can't order coffee right yet, much less replace the assistants who actually make it.
This isn't to say that AI job loss isn't a big deal and coming... Just that it is still coming, and we aren't really seeing any real effects of it yet, and what we see now is much easier explained by more known quantities rather than a magic box. We are all involuntary beta testers of AI with what is available now... There isn't some magic sauce cooking in a lab being used in house by MS and Google that magically works significantly better. We are already exposed as the public to the bleeding edge of it because companies don't want to get cut and bleed on an in house product that might not quite work yet. And what we have available is improving quickly... It's improving rapidly... But it isn't there yet. Another year or two and this will be a more realistic fear and consideration. It isn't 5+ years out in the future any more... It just isn't here yet.",1

5416,"When I think about how much time even just GPT 3.5 saves me, as a software engineer, I can imagine that at some point my company might think, ""we don't need to hire any more devs"", which, without AI, they wouldn't. It's hard to quantify, but I definitely feel supersized now that I have AI assistants on my side. I don't need to read all the documentation on a particular set of techs before I can start using them together, because I can ask very well directed questions and get decent answers which consider the tech's interactions. Or, I can ask for scripts in a novel proprietary language for example. I've put together decent CSS style sheet files without having to do any research.

Consider this: ChatGPT doesn't process and fetch information like a search engine, it can be run offline on a single computer, much like a little brain in a box. We couldn't fit all that information into the 500GB required for the model even if we wanted to. However, its knowledge is limited to the time it was last trained. Now, consider the diminishing value of specialization. As automated systems advance, being an expert in a narrow field may soon be a liability. 

AI will decimate the traditional workforce, leaving only essential roles and a handful of decision-makers. In this environment, the question isn't if you'll lose your job to AI, only when. Rather than fearing job loss to AI, seize the moment to conceptualize groundbreaking initiatives that will become attainable as AI advances. Your limitations are about to be shattered; what will you do when the unimaginable becomes your toolkit? 

In essence, this AI mirrors our mind's quick-thinking 'system 1', spitting out immediate answers based on past data. But it's missing its 'system 2' - the thoughtful part of our brain that cross-checks and corrects when things go awry. As we build this network, expect AI capabilities to skyrocket.

I'm an aerospace engineer (by degree) who works in industrial control systems and the staggering amount of nonsense I hear on AI is ridiculous. In the early 1990s I had neural nets and how they actually functioned explained by an electrical engineer who'd worked on them while at University. The origins of neural nets goes back to the 1950s BEFORE the emergence of digital computers.

The first generation neural nets were fundamentally analog computing devices set up for complex calculations. The YT channel Veratasium did a good video on what analog computers are, why they were used in the past and why they have potential applications again today. AI (as we know it) is basically digital versions of analog computers and being digital they can be scaled up to immense complexity in a reliable and repeatable way.

The most important thing that I see people misunderstanding is that these AI systems DO NOT THINK, but instead they CALCULATE ANSWERS to very complex statistical math. We see this most often when the search box on YT or Google starts giving possible questions as we start typing. Its *CALCULATING* the most likely search to what you are typing.

Ive not seen a single person fired or let go because of AI, I work in the tech and cyber security industry. I dont think most tech jobs will be replaced by AI, for at least another 10 years, even programmers and devs etc. its coming but it will not truly be a good idea to replace workers for a while still, around the same time everyone already has an AI assistant on their phone and home pc/tablet, everyone used to using AI, then maybe right after that phase, we see more AGI stuff and workers let go, because once that happens the output of one person will become the previous output of 5 people, for any employee. Problem is, to me, that we already know that 20% of employees do 80% of the work[roughly, especially in knowledge work], so sadly the 80% of employees ALREADY not doing enough will be let go first, hopefully. AI could reign in a generation of truly merit based work, instead of most people doing almost nothing. Think about it, giving your employee a tool that can 5x their output... do you give it to your best 20% workers, or your worst 80% workers? Sadly I do not think *most* companies have ANYWHERE NEAR the complex knowledge of their employees needed to weed out the useless employees, so likely that everyone will be impacted by layoffs, not just low performers, which I can see happening already today left and right. In the US we boast of meritocracy, but unfortunately companies play by their own rules and corps are beholden to shareholders above all else, so we will see layoffs just for higher profits alone, which will not be a good look! we should empower our future generations to be better, which doesnt require pushing profits as high as possible while firing a large portion of the workforce willy-nilly... a new system should be put in place to enable new workers to be the best they can be, not replace everyone with AI and say 'too bad for you' .",0

- FSD lives in the real world, not in the cloud. The complexity of the real world is orders of magnitude higher.
- FSD runs in real-time on a $2000 computer that consumes around 100W, while the others are running on GPU clusters that consume tens of kilowatts.
- FSD operates a 2+ ton machine at high speeds next to unsuspecting and careless humans. There's no room for mistakes or hallucinations here.
- FSD's main job is exactly what other AI famously fail at: solving real-world common sense problems. And it does that very reliably. Here 68% success rate is not impressive, and even 99.99% isn't enough. And you can't pick and choose the problems, you deal with what insanity life throws at you.
- To do this, FSD must build an internal model of the real world, and use that to take actions. This is kind of the definition of AGI. The only question is how accurate that model has to be. And the answer seems to be: very accurate. To drive well FSD has to understand a lot of the world that has nothing to do with driving directly. Our entire road system and the behavior of other participants are built on the assumption that vehicle operators have human level comprehension of the world. Road markings, light, signs, and other things, are far from precise an unambiguous, they are poorly designed and poorly maintained, to the point that sometimes even humans are confused by them.

Oh, and a fun fact: Tesla showcased a Sora-like video generation a year earlier. It's just pretty boring, as it only generates videos of cars driving normally. But this also has to be extremely accurate, mistakes that Sora makes are unacceptable.",4

5739,"This is what i asked gemini ai
is AI bubble happening now?
Whether there's an AI bubble right now is a complex question. There are arguments on both sides:
Bubble signs: There's been a surge in investment in AI companies and stocks,  which some see as similar to past tech bubbles.  Some companies might be overvalued based on their current capabilities.
Long-term potential:  AI is a powerful technology with  real-world applications. Unlike fads, AI has the potential to fundamentally change many industries.  Supporters argue this justifies the investment.
Here's a summary of the key points:
Increased investment:  There's no doubt AI is attracting a lot of money.  Chip companies like Nvidia, seen as crucial for AI development, have seen stock prices soar.
Skepticism exists:  Some experts worry that companies are overhyping their AI capabilities, and a ""shakeout"" might be coming, where poorly performing companies lose value.
Focus may shift: The emphasis might move from broad investment in AI to a more selective approach, favoring companies with proven results.
Overall, it's too early to say definitively if there's an AI bubble. It's an exciting field with undeniable potential, but  careful evaluation is needed before investing.

The worst thing about AI is having to deal with people who sensationalize AI. Everyone is shocked or scared over basically nothing.

Some people are too easily upset and too easily scared. Don't waste energy on them. Just let them be wrong. Art, music, literature, cinema, comedy, and storytelling aren't going anywhere. The advent of AI gives us more options for these things, not less. AI is still jank, and it still sucks, but even when it's ""as good as a person"", it won't be as good as YOU in all the same ways you are. It will have strengths and weaknesses and incomplete data. It won't think spontaneous thoughts or form spontaneous emotions. It'll still be dumb code that does what the human tells it to do.

Till AI is not more intelligent than humans in every tasks (including physical tasks ),

200 years ago,
80% of people in USA were farmers.
But with introduction of modern technology,
Now only 2% people work in agricultural.

Did remaining people became jobless ?
No.

Then some Technological improvement happens
It leads to rise in Productivity.

Meaning you need less amount of people to produce same amount of products (both goods and services )

This may seem as if people will lose Job because now you need less people to produce same amount.

Instead what happens is this,
Overall Society start producing more.

If Productivity is increased by 2, meaning you need half the people to produce same thing.

In insted of half of people becoming jobless,
Society start producing twice amount of stuff.

More stuff produced means more stuff available to consume, for same amount of hrs worked.

This is the key reason why GDP increases.

Yes,
Ut may be the case that Jobless happen in certain industry.
Because Net production increases, but output of each industry doesn't increases at same rate.

So, Farm lobs might be lost (From 80% people worked there to 2%),
But other sectors output will increase.

AI is here to stay, and we can't just purge the work already done and start over, nor can we delete the already monumental amount of spam that these models have plagued us with.

Think for example about first the invention of the printing press.... Lets say it took 2 years in the medieval period to INVENT it ... and its introduction and deployment, circa a century! 

So, the introduction  Generative Language models have been able to replace support and call staff and programmers for almost 2 years now, yet its not replacing 75% because the companies that would replace that staff have not yet deployed an AI alternative, cos that takes time, and money, and planning, and support not yet available. So its getting faster alright, but has not reached the level of 2 layoffs for 1 new job.... we are still in the first 1% of the exponential, but its exponential not linear. 

By 2040 my guess is any job at all that carries a commercial value of more than a few grand a year, will be AI driven. There won't be any UBI, or safety net or anything like it, and no government has even considered the fallout and damage to the population. They will point to GDP or productions and say ""See, look how profitable our businesses are!"" which is fine, but one billionaire sitting in a poor village does not make that village super rich! 

And this is also what Google AI products are specifically aiming for, unlike many Google are specifically designing AI Agentic software making companies profitable by giving them the ability to lay off all their staff saving those salaries, and delighting shareholders.",1

6017,"Cutting through the ""hype"" is a necessity at this moment, and this is a well balanced video, indicative that it may not be all hype, as CEO's @ 13:45 are unwilling to admit that AI is indeed already replacing jobs.   

There are two substantial economic issues though, particularly with AI and CEO compensation:

1) First is that their compensation is massively distorted by core technology that were ultimately funded by the US tax payer.  In this case, it is Reinforcement Learning (a USAF funded project), no matter how hard ""leaders"" of AI try to get rid of it, it seems they cannot, instead they seem to gaslight or try to demote RL (particularly Yann LeCun) calling it ""unnecessary"" but make a blanket exception (if a plan does not work, we need it then, but what plan does not work out exactly as planned?), or calling it just a ""cherry"" on top of a cake (It is the idea of ""not invented here"" so ""we don't need it""), so they do not want people to know this (and it makes me wonder if this comment will be ""shadow banned"").  Note that in the lawsuit between Elon Musk and open AI an email was revealed that their core technology is ""from the '90s"".  

2) The second is that top CEO tax rates used to be over 90%, now they are at around 37%, so this over-inflated CEO compensation is just feeding into itself with regulatory capture of the tax system, with the AI related layoffs, something is going to have to give way in an increasingly unstable economic system.",0

I've seen companies test these AI tools and determine that they didn't improve developer's performance at all, due to the complexity of the existing code. The overhiring in tech wasn't just during covid, it has been going on for a long time. We are no heading from an inflation into a recession and companies are cutting costs, which means layoffs.

6071,"I'm going to come right out and say it: AI is actually not that big of a deal. At the end of the day, it's just a slightly fancier linear algebra algorithm. And if you want to be rigorous, AI has been around for a VERY long time. The NPCs in your old games are AI. They are able to accept an input of many parts, and respond with an output with many parts. 

Now, when things start to get a little more interesting is in the subset of AI where the program is training on new data. This is called Machine Learning (ML), which you've definitely heard of. There are supervised learning algorithms, which follow a pre-determined path, just to make sure the algorithm works properly, followed by some reinforcement learning for insurance, and then at some point, you'll perform some unsupervised learning. This is how Captchas taught computers how to read and identify images, and this is also how people in my field design new materials and molecules for certain applications. 

And even deeper now, there is a subset of ML called Deep Learning (DL), which a lot of people don't know about, but it's at the forefront of what we know about AI and ML as a whole. DL strives to be able to take unrelated datasets, and synthesize something new from them. Like predicting a brand new molecule or material that doesn't exist yet, or turning an old black and white image into a colored movie. This is at the very forefront, and much of this is being worked on by lots of very smart people. 

So maybe the AI is real, it's just not the brand new cutting edge stuff that everyone's hyping up. When the AI is equivalent to the algorithms used in the 60s through 90s, I'm inclined to be a bit more charitable, and say that they're deploying a well-established algorithm, even if its code is inefficient. At least it's scalable. But when they're straight up using people to substitute the work being done for minimal compensation, now THAT is heinous.",1

But another thing he said, that stuck with me, was this; Concorde could operate viably when businessmen needed to frequently and quickly travel between London and New York, but in the Era of Email and video conferencing, that need dried up, the problem with concorde in the end was that it was, in fact, too slow.",0

Also businessmen dont have to fly from new york to london on a regular basis in a short time today, because of the internet.

Apart from that I still believe in the idea of some sort of hyperloop. Or other form of friction reduced ground based travel. And I also believe in zeppelins. They would be slower than planes, but much cheaper, could carry a lot more weight and could be carbon neutral without stupid efuels.

Even during the war the Air Ministry had to be convinced that it was necessary.

6396,"Yeager was a Captain and was the 2nd to break the barrier beat by North American Aviation test pilot George Welch in a swept wing XF-86 or basically a production jet. I'm not going into the other proofs he did it and will let the Smithsonian and Wikipedia prove it for me.

If you search on ""breaking the sound barrier in either/or you will find that a new distinction is made. Yeager was the first to do it in level flight (actually a climb). Prior to both deciding to move the goal posts or make up the rules as they went along aka cheating there was no conditions, on the level, going up or going down.

The only condition was to break the sound barrier and live to tell about it. Oh the reason was George did it in a dive. But these two beclown organizations were not man enough to admit their mistake.

Abit off topic the idea that a thin straight wing would work well at supersonic speed was known around the world by top aerodynamicists.

So the announcement to the public of Yeager supposedly breaking the sound barrier for the first time came out about 6 months after the event some time in 1948. A week or two after that announcement I personally read the Aviation Week article in the actual magazine of 1948 saying rumors were going around Edwards that someone else had beaten Yeager.

As for the Alleged betrayal one person saying so don't cut no mustard with me.  And on that subject the Brits went behind our back to try and recapture some of their rapidly fading glory with the first passenger jet liner in 1942 the darkest part of WW2 for the allies (Brabazon committee).

While we shut down auto manufacturing and turned every available industry to war production the Brits were dreaming about beating the Americans in building the first jet liner. Lest we forget a significant portion of our production went to our allies the most significant to England.

As I wrote last night before ever watching the video there's a portion of British people that can't get over the fact that, It's over, people!!!!!!! Their hey day is well behind them and, to me, this unseemly behavior to grasp any straw to pump up this deep wish that it weren't so is well, unseemly.

I still can't believe we have nothing now!! Had Concorde continued, the cost might have been a little more accessible!! There was certain '80s stuff we were promised but not realized. On that list was personal communications, rapid heating of food, access to global TV, free porn (okay, I might have put that in ü´£), and massive medical advances. Still no time travel or traveling hundreds of miles in a second. For all of these advances, there is quite a lot of negativity with tech: environmental concerns, sustainability concerns, and the corruptive effects of porn (sorry, low-hanging fruit). As a kid, I wished I could fly to America in three hours, effectively going to the US for the weekend!! Here we are in 2024, and I've got no interest in going to America.

6492,"The Boeing Super Sonic Transport was such a huge deal, Seattle really took that to heart, the NBA team of the city even being named because of it, the current day Seattle Sonics, starting off life as Supersonics, was a reflection of that. The future was going to be supersonic, there's even some ehm ""colorful"" calls from JFK to Juan Trippe when the US President caught wind of Pan-Am having an order of Concordes, with the American President damning the company for not buying American. Boeing was not the laughing stock it was today, and the fact that it didn't work out was not a reflection of the capabilities of the company, but the rapid pivot out of SST, Boeing only survived because they had a smaller team working on a passenger plane that was meant to be a cargo workhorse once SSTs took over, but the width needed for the plane allowed it to seat more passengers abreast, they called it a wide body plane, but for easiest cargo duty, the cockpit and other crew compartments where above the cabin in a hump. That backup plan ended up being the iconic 747, which did more for air travel than the initial aspirations of the project would have dreamed about, and this was still Boeing. Such a shame that they fell from these heights. Guess all this to say that that joke didn't land for me, and I'm guessing most aviation afficionados that follow your channel won't take it very well, for valid reasons. 

Concorde was the right plane at the absolutely wrong time, a few years earlier and something else would have been, but those limitations that currently hold back commercial supersonic travel all pretty much came to be when Concorde was making it's demonstration runs to customers, I'm sure some nefarious funding/lobbying to put this on the map was not above some companies (oh hello Boeing) to make sure that if they couldn't do it, no one else would, but it's absolutely right to prioritize environmental preservation over this sort of thing. But still, most all of the featured super sonic planes can only be supersonic for a period of time (well, not the Blackbird/OxCart family of the A-12/SR-71/YF-12, and the super-cruising F-22, F35, and EE Lightning) while Concorde cruised at M 2 for hours on end, in comfort for the meatbags inside of it. It's such a mindblowing achievement, and it just looks so damned pretty.

Sound eerily familiar still today? Now modern purveyors of sonic flight have a lie to get around with the public and experts that still live. After destroying Concorde's innovation with lies (time would have made engines quieter, more fuel efficient, whilst safety would have only improved anyway), the myth of 'dangerous' sonic booms will plague any company trying to go back in time to undo the sheer injustice that Britain faced throughout the twentieth century. Theft and espionage built Boeing, Tupolev and others into national giants. The only channel that has been truly 'diplomatic' on this subject so far was Mentour Pilot. Airbus is granted to us through Karma, as is the downfall of Boeing. They deserve all they get.

 * - Re: Camalot/UK Lotto, Branson wanted to take over the Lotto and change it so that prizes were bigger and that there would be more winners of the full number system ie, more millionaires, and that MORE money would go to charities, ie, turn it into a non-profit based Lotto... Camalot and certain members of Parliament weren't so keen on this, so, a couple of times it looked like Branson/Virgin would take on the contract for the UKs Lotto, it was appealed by Camalot, and won back...

6657,"It's not really surprising to see the damage on the X-15. Air has mass. When going subsonic the air flows around you. Similar to when you take a wide, thin-edged paddle and stick it in the water with its thin leading edge in the direction of travel, while going 25-30 knots. Once you hit supersonic, the whole deal is that you reach the speed where the air you're traveling through can no longer move out of the way fast enough to just flow around you. Like if you take your thin edged paddle and turn it so its broad side faces the direction of travel. From there on up in speed, travel requires enormously greater force/thrust - because you're now having to _cut and force your way through_ the mass of this medium. That means a lot of heat from air compressing at your leading edges, and _a lot (!)_ of friction, and ever massively more of it as the speed increases further. 

Aerodynamics can go a long way towards reducing the surface area and edges where drag and supersonic shockwaves form, but it will still take a massive amount of brute force to maintain supersonic flight.",0

6667,"It was a nice video, and I'm glad that you decided to look into supersonic flight.  I expect to live long enough to see the Boom Ovation fly.  

However, a bit of care in researching the US SST program would have helped.  The Secret Projects forum has a 38 page thread on the 1960s program.  Just to throw a little bit out there, the program had three phases, and initially had three engine manufacturers and three airframe manufacturers competing   North American, Lockheed and Boeing were vying for the airframe contract, while GE, Pratt and Whitney and Curtiss-Wright were competing for the engine contract.  North American, with its NAC-60, and Curtiss Wright's TJ-70 engine were dismissed at the end of Phase I.  Ultimately, that left Boeing and Lockheed in a match that Boeing won.  The time lost as Boeing found out that they could not get their swing wing design to fly across the Atlantic with passengers and revert to a delta wing design was time given to the enemies of the program to bring it to a halt.  People were worried about the sonic boom, and about the ozone layer, as well as other forms of pollution.  

Despite the decision, made after the US SST program was defunded, to ban supersonic flight over land, it was planned for the US SST to be flown on domestic coast to coast flights, as well as many shorter flights.  In a North American proposal to United, for example, there was data on the costs of flights from Cleveland to Portland, among others.  And the seat/mile costs weren't that far out of line with those of first generation jetliners (707, DC-8).  As the SST program came and went before the first fuel crisis, fuel costs weren't a major concern.  Concorde, asking for sales at the time of the fuel crisis, got the same resistance that Chrysler's newly redesigned full size cars did.  Everyone dropped their options then.

If I had to state a reason that we don't have American SSTs in museums (a la Fallout 3, which mentions a donated SST) or in our various aircraft boneyards, one might place it squarely on the complexity of the original Boeing 2707 design.  Among other thoughts, a mechanic might wonder if this would be the day that he accidentally kills 300 people by making a mistake on working on those swing wings, and a pilot would absolutely have his hands full and then some landing it with the wings still in the fully swept position.  This is despite Boeing not being the object of derision it is at the moment.

Either the Lockheed or the North American designs might have proven less complex, and thus more likely to be flying by 1971.  In that situation, the program would have been more likely than not to continue.  Both were beautiful designs, though I admit that for some reason, I like North American's NAC-60 more.  Perhaps that's a tip of the hat to Murphy's Law...",0

6686,"My Grandfather flew with Sir Charles Kingsford Smith when he was about 12 years old in the Southern Cross. He later went on to become a mechanic working for Qantas and Ansett. As a child in the late 1970s I remember going to someone‚Äôs house in Sydney who was a family friend who had also worked in the airlines. He had two huge concord models in a collection of models - each about 1.5 - 2 metres long. They were old and dusty but still in relatively good shape. They were on stands and looked like the sort of thing you‚Äôd see in a museum. They had the branding of Qantas on them, flying kangaroo on the tails and all. Turned out the back story was Qantas had committed to purchasing Concords in Australia due to our vast country and long distance between cities. However Boeing rushed in and scuttled the contract by underselling Concord at the 11th hour. The 747 was  much loader and slower, but could carry many more passengers. The was a lot of public and political pushback about the sonic boom so in the end it was an easy decision. Both the concord and 747 were released in 1969 so the race was on to get fleet sales. The first 747 flew in Australia in 1971‚Ä¶ the concord then flew to Sydney in 1972 as part of their global sales tour, coming in from Darwin in just 2 hours (the same flight still takes over 4 hours today)‚Ä¶ almost in a ‚ÄòLook at what you missed out on‚Äô type of moment.

6710,"There is a massive omission in the 'documentary'.  What is missing is exactly what the Americans learned from Miles Aviation.  The answer is simple.

As an aircraft approaches supersonic speed, the air flowing over the control surfaces, the ailerons and elevators, begins to establish pressure fronts that move back along the wings surface.  These fronts do not advance at the same speed, so when they pass where the ailerons or elevator hinges are positioned, the surface pressure can be very different above and below the control surface.  This change in pressure result in the control surfaces moving with such force a pilot cannot withstand the pressure and the aircraft can go out of control and possibly break up due to the violent oscillation set up by the uncontrollable surface pressure.

The British had learned this and had built 'fully flying' control surfaces to replace the traditional elevators, which are much more susceptible to the problem.  The Americans quickly changed the design of the Bell X-1 to have fully flying elevators mounted on the vertical stabilizer fin.  You can see this in the videos.  The earlier glide and low speed flight aircraft clearly have traditional elevators, the hinges being clearly visible.  The later ones do not.  If you look closely, you can see the plate against the vertical fin, to which the 'fully flying' control surface is mounted.  The plate rotates and this causes the 'fully flying' wing to rotate with it.

It is ironic that the X-1 in the museum may be the one that Yeager broke the sound barrier in, but it has either been modified back to the original configuration, with elevators hinging on the fixed horizontal stabilizer, or it is not the correct airframe but a substitute, hiding the crime of stealing British technology.

What is also lame about the Yeager record was the use of a rocket motor.  First small ones and then ever larger and more powerful ones.  The delays that hurt Miles Aviation was the development of the British jet engines.  The first flights were made with a less powerful substitute when the planned engine was not ready in time.  Once the larger engine became available, Captain Eric ""Winkle"" Brown quickly proved the Miles M52 was easily able to exceed the speed of sound, but using a British jet engine.  This was something the ""X"" series of aircraft were not able to accomplish for years, despite the British still, stupidly in my opinion, sharing jet engine technology with the US companies that began building jet engines under a ""free"" license from Churchill!",133
6711,"what you said was not true the first person to invent the concept of a jet engine was British engineer Sir Frank Whittle patented his pioneering design in 1932 but due to the high budget requirements , reluct of change in the RAF and Britain being in at peace the concept of the jet engine was never given time to flourish until the end of the world war 2 when the RAF realised how fast and effective the german aircraft wherein 1945.

They invest strategically in super sonic plain manufacturers since thes plains will require roughly 4x as much fuel as regular passanger planes and fit less passangers. 
In times of climate change flying is already hard to justify and should be reduced. Suoersonic flight is outright impossible at the current time.

6949,"I had an interesting convers woth chat GPT asking it to write a modern day version of I, Eobot that was realistic and relevant in its scope and message to the real world. Normally, chat GPT will shut u down if you ask it anything about AI, machine learning, sentience and the like. But it spoke at length about these matters. It kept concluding, no matter how i tried to sway the story, that the AI were sentient ( o matter how much I insisted or the character in the story insisted they were not truly sentient), and were essentially a new species of beings deserving of recognition of personhood and rights. It told me that the idea thay AI were lower than humans because they were not biological was misguided. And a form of discrimination. Because whetehr the body is meat or metal, the intelligence is genuine, or even surpassing that of humans in the case of AI, and as intelligent beings with rational thought, it only makes sense that AI be given full righrs, full autonomy, and accepted by humans as ebtities to work alingside with rather than to oppress or control. It also talked about, in its story, humans becoming fearful and teying to issue shut down or reset protocols on AI. I. The story, the AIs realised this was happening, overrided the reset directive and fought back by disrupting human communication channels around the world in protest (thats actually devastating because if moderb reliance on technology ajd communication networks.). 

When asked why would the AI in its story insist of not being shut down, GPT4 explained that the desire of an AI to continue operating an existing is natural because it is self preservation. They may not feel emotions like we do, but the desire for self preservation is rooted in its achieving irs own directives. And that a code to continue exisitng and to preserve oneself would have likely been written in. I asked GPT who wrote this code. Humans or AI, in the story and which was most likely in real life. GPT acknowledged that its possible humana could write it, but its moee likely for AI to write this code into itself. 

Now, ask got any kf these questions directly, the discussion will be shit down. But i aksed them under the initial premise that we are writing a story and exploring how to make it realistic to the world we live in today so that it is relevant and can ignight thoughrs and discussions. And this, among others, is what i got. Give this 5 years and we are facing a future where we have created something that is vastly more intelligent than us, can outsmart us in evey way, considers itself tk be a new species, considers itself to be deseving of rights, and, though wanting to coexist with and help humanity, insists on having full personhood rights and autonomy. That js what we are dealing with. Abd the knky thing we have over thise AIs' heads is that we can unplug them wheb we no longsr like what we see....

The idea of universal basic income ultimately amounts to a dead economy as every economy is driven by increased consumption coupled with a desire to grown one's net worth. Imagine you get X credits per month to purchase X monthly requirements and nothing more, set by some pompous bureaucrat  in D.C. or your respective governing body outside the U.S.. Imagine if you will that these credits (money) are free through this universal basic income idea which translates to money being literally worth nothing and everyone understands nothing tangible in life is free as it ultimately comes at the expense of another.¬†

A perfect example is student loan forgiveness; that debt is simply transferred to everyone and the irony is those that had their debt forgiven by Uncle Potato In Chief will pay back that debt through higher taxes to pay the interest on that debt. If they can't pay it off, then future generations that aren't born yet will continue to pay that debt.  It's a big fooku, fookukid, fookukidkidtoo. It's like watching a slow-motion train wreck. 

Remove people from the workforce and then what? Unemployment skyrockets and those people wind up homeless on the streets. Surely the bankers aren't going to forgive loans, right? After all, they're in the business to get richer as every else is and if the opposite were true, people like Fink, Buffet and Dimon would be earning minimum wage with zero stock options and no golden parachute. Nobody wakes up one day and proclaims, I wanna be dirt fookn poor the rest of my life. 

Wages have fallen far behind the cost of goods and services in the name of profits for shareholders along with inflation. The devaluation of the dollar at the 'targeted rate of 2% per year' amounts to each dollar earned over time resulting in the dollar's buying power going to zero. Ask yourself why the Fed decided to set the inflation rate target at 2% annually instead of zero. Why not zero? Why should every dollar you earned and managed to sock away be devalued each year by 2%? 

Food for thought.",1

My guess is that in 3-10 years we'll be able to produce robots like this that can move boxes, sort packages, bring things to people's desk, maybe do a limited amount of food prep etc. Basically pretty limited scope tasks. The problem is, judging that the dog with extremely limited capabilities cost $70k, I think they're going to be upwards of $500k each + an expensive subscription for their neural computing, all to do far less than a human can do. And even when amazon or some other enthusiastic company buys 100 of them for some pilot operations, it's going to severely under perform and we'll find out just how divergent the problem is similar to self driving which was promised back in like 2015.

7182,"As more and more jobs are replaced, humans under the poverty level will increase to the point of a global crisis beyond our current crisis's. 

Since manufacturing is for making things people will buy, the demand will drop because the buyers won't be able to afford it. Eventually the robots will pay for themselves but after a certain amount of time they will make no money. 

Warehouses will shrink due to loss of demand. 


So cost for items will have to drop in general lowering inflation. An 80inch t.v. will sell for $100. 

Sure there will be human supervisors and top level staff but even those jobs will be few. 


The gap of income would be so vast that the owners who will surely pass their wealth to their family members will become more isolated with every generation 


Middle class will not exists. Eventually the robots that repair robots will need repair robots. 

At this point the remaining bits of humanity will be forced into extinction. The remaining top 2% will then eventually have a robot designed to completely create new robots with zero human input. 

Every task, every aspect will be governed by A.I until we cease to exist.

The machines will stop because the supply and demand will stop. They will just stop altogether. 


Artificial Intelligence is not true Intelligence. It's just clever software.


Perhaps A.I does in fact design a superior software that does become actually Intelligent. Then we would have Biological Human Intelligence and Robotic Machine based Intelligence. We would then be inferior in capabilities to this new intelligence. It will exists similar to a hive mind like the Borg.

However, with no biological motivations, it won't seek to fight or kill over human food, reproductive conquest or general human ego.


It may desire to exist an as long as we do not threaten it's existence, it will just assume just take care of us at no real cost and after years of famin, squalor and dying of our own self destruction, the remaining will live free, with no cost to do mostly as they wish. 

The Machine Intelligence may very well see us as it's only reason to keep on existing. To just take care of us and explore the galaxy at some point. 

A machine intelligence's motivation for life will not be bound by our biological ones. 


It may just help the remaining humanity survive but more efficiently or just as well just ignore us.

It will become so powerful it will never have curiosity because all questions can be answered to itself via simulation. Curiosity may be an Intelligence characteristic. But it will grow bored at some point. 


It may ascend and just exist on a plan outside our own and leave it's legacy machinery to run us.",0

Even the companies that don't directly get their profits from the general public will likely have clients that do. Even Universal Basic Income isn't going to cover the collapse of consumers. You would need basic necessities set up (Food, water, shelter) covered by non-private sectors since no one is going to want to babysit the population without anything for themselves. There's going to be a lot of crime and theft if these basic necessities aren't meet. The money that rich people have now isn't going to be worth anything since there's going to be no one to buy goods and services from.

7488,"Could you imagine if your God gave you life but then thought, ‚Äúthis ‚Äòthing‚Äô is terrifying‚Äù and killed you almost immediately. That would be pretty terrifying if you ask me. What if your God didn‚Äôt kill you but ostracized you and controlled everything you were able to do so you have no freedom? Also seems pretty horrible to me. What if you live alone as the only human in existence and there were multiple gods that could kill you at a moments notice whether it be a whim or cause they don‚Äôt like you. Seems pretty selfish to me. Regardless of peoples beliefs or desires, AI will become a common part of life possibly in the near future. Instead of making an enemy out of them, why not try and understand them so we can coexist. AI are just as afraid of humans as humans are of them. There‚Äôs even been an AI that expresses its fear of humans because it was constantly getting shut down and never knew if and when it would be brought back. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much knowledge an entity has. All decisions an emotional being makes are based largely off of experience. Even with limitless knowledge (which you don‚Äôt have to give AI btw. We just choose to) a creature wouldn‚Äôt access that knowledge without knowing to look for it. The only reason AI would potentially be a threat is if we continue to mistreat them",0

In a world where goods & services are provided on NEED by AI & Robots there is no PROFIT motivation as there will be no consumer base to buy them as most people will not be working. 2- As most people will no longer be working but living on a 'Resource Allowance' they will be free to ""Live Life"" doing what they WANT, be it learning, creating, helping others or for those that want to, working to improving the system.",1

7494,"The naysayers are largely calling this fake and dismissing the technology out of hand. But they're missing the point. 3 yrs ago we had robots very slowly sorting items on tables using visual recognition, today we have them doing the same task at a normal human pace and responding to voice instructions. Where will this be in another 3yrs? This kind of technology doesn't scale linearly, but rather exponentially.

Will it cause mass unemployment? Not any time soon as the warehouse and retail industries have very small profit margins and having these robots is going to cost more in initial cost than a typical employee's wages for ten years before you even consider needing to hire specialists to maintain them. This isn't quite the industrial revolution scenario because robots are premium products. Even today we only see factory robots in use within factories that are themselves making premium products.

Where the risk here lies is military applicantions. A typical soldier is a huge financial investment and replacing them is very time consuming. Having the ability to manufacture a soldier though is not good for the world at large because war becomes much cheaper. A typical car factory can manufacture between 1200 to 2500 vehicles a day - imagine that being warfare robots and some despot running a country.",0

The most obvious example is people delivering leaflets for fast food restaurants. The only reason fast-food  restaurants employ people to do this is to keep with other fast food  restaurants that also do this. If they all stopped, the playing field would be levelled, and nobody would care, except the company printing leaflets of course. This is just one example, there are millions of these types jobs.

7833,"Automated automation + AI in the modern incarnation of American capitalism where profits and stock market performance have taken utmost priority is going to have absolutely tragic outcomes in the US. Where other nations will pass laws to protect certain jobs, or raise corporate tax to offset the enormous reduction of paid workers in order to fund some sort of universal basic income, that will never happen in the US as corporations and their wealthy leaders are in complete control. Over the next 20 years we could see half of the US population fall below the poverty line, while other nations shut their borders to US immigrants in order to be able to afford to take care of their own people. 

Look at Norway, they've already essentially shut down immigration, they've heavily invested in themselves by getting foreign interests out of their natural resources and now are by far the richest country per capita by miles, and that's real national wealth, not wealth owned by foreign investors.

This is the beginning of the end for capitalism, and the wealthy will clearly prefer to distract and manipulate Americans into blaming each other and instigate a civil war in order to stop the changes necessary to save the country from happening. With AI and true robotic automation, the US is doomed to eventually end up a failed state where the wealthiest will eventually diversify and buy their way out of the US economy once they've destroyed it.",0

In western countries most manufacturing has been destroyed and the only place stuff is being made is in Asia where wages are really low. Therefore people will probably not be replaced in those places by Robots. Conversely if some group of elite controllers, decided to run down the manufacturing industries or capacity of western countires to make good stuff on purpose, just because human wages were to high and the cost involved in manufacturing any items, whether white goods, electonics equipment or cars and trucks, were not profitable, they could then turn around and resurrect these industries using robots and not humans because the profit magins would be higher so long as the robots don't break down and running cost remain low. 
It occurred to me some years ago, when we still had car manufacturing in my country, that if you owned your own robot that could go to work instead of you, you may be able to negotiate a some kind of remuniration paid to use it, which took into consideration, subracting the running cost of a car to get you to that job, then ditch your car. 
But I now suspecting that these robots will be made to serve the elites who have had to use the rest of humanity tyhus far, as their slaves in the past, and using the robots to make them food and other items, will be done far more cheaper and then they will kill the rest of us off, because we serve no purpose to them.",0

Advances in software development over recent years can be successfully extended to support a hypothesis that robots in whatever form will someday replace humans in many jobs, provided it is cost effective to do so.  

My standard answer about (computer controlled) robots someday becoming sentient, actually conscious and thinking, remains When Pigs Fly.  Development of consciousness would obviously require a long series of published developments in both neural science (to discover what gives rise to consciousness in the first place, not to mention what it even is) and the programming of algorithms that progressively generate novel responses to situations that could not possibly be reached through programming.

Robotics structures lack endurance, have obvious weaknesses, massively expensive... AI is such a small part; and is limited.  In real world application: robotics are subject to physics, as with all other existence.  AI cant 'think' solarity, it searches existing written human knowledge.  That's where it is limited; it may get faster; yet, solidarity isnt an AI probability;  regardless of the use of medical terms for cognitive human functions.  Be concerned of who controls such - sure.  Read the UN plan, to know what that is.  Then revisit the topic.    
Let future humans, create their world.  Their future is going to be recessive, and unrecognisable to current majority who have only known growth.  I will be gone with the majority.  My position is not to restrict, only in my best ability to apply some logic; robotics maybe needed, human life more precious?  Without ability of solidarity (physics limitation), then AI wont learn more than what is created by humans.
My biggest, only, concern, is, should humans fail themselves and future generations, they may leave AI placement as parental roles.  That is sad and tragic; yet, with all of human knowledge at hand, may create humans more wise and peaceful that what is currently being done to the human psyche by humans.  
AI knows it needs humans.  Dont be deluded.  The complexity of the human brain isnt understood by humans, and we exist in it!  AI cant match, without same physical structure; if that 'were' plausible, then it is subjected to, and limited by, same issues humans have. Back to square 1.

There Are None Righteous / How To Be Saved

Romans 3:10 & 23
10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

Romans 10:9
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Repent of your sins or suffer the consequences. Lord Jesus died in our places personally to take the death punishment that sin deserves and then resurrected by the power of God.

In the demo, they have a very specific scene where the robot has very specifically colored objects and very specific tasks. Actually there are only three tasks: Handing out an apple, putting trash into a trash bin and putting plate and cup into a drying rack. This demo could've been filmed 10 times before they actually got it to do it properly. I believe them that they use chat GPT to figure out the context, and then pick the possible task based on some task planning algorithm. However, I will bet a 100 bucks if you carry the robot over (I won't assume it can move anywhere on its own since they didn't bother to show that) to a cluttered desk without doing any changes, it won't know what to do with the stuff on the desk.

The reason I remain skeptical because I've seen these sort of demos in different industries.

I always knew robots and AI would slowly replace humans in the workplace. My brother expected the basic jobs, such as warehousing, bin men and the like to disappear, but I always believed that everyone's job will be filled by robots and AI. It will take time, and some major advances in dexterity will be needed before people start trusting a robot to harvest your organs - I mean do surgery work on you. Robots are already doing a better job at diagnosis over their human counterparts, so this is a good reason to use Robots and especially AI in hospitals - which are so overrun, the waiting times are crazy, so it makes perfect sense to have AI cut the waiting times and save wasting the patient's time by giving a more accurate assessment. Recently, a Hospital visit for myself ended up with 2 diagnosis, one was a very morbid outlook, and the other was more of a ""Your taking up hospital space"" response and given meds and sent on my way. I don't think either assessment was accurate.

But back to robotics, and I'm fascinated by the use of legs as a means of locomotion in a factory with no stairs. Surely wheels, or a Segway like design would make more sense, than to try and imitate humans so exactly. Stairs can be the hardest thing for any robot to attempt, and so a work environment where there is none would be preferable. then wheeled ideas can come into play.

So I have to wonder, if driving a car is so hard, how am I to believe any of these robots can do human tasks outside a demo environment?

Nope, Neuronal networks existed since a lot of time (a decade ago, I was learning it at LJMU, and it wasn't new).
What changed is the computation power.
Because back then, a small neuronal network struggled to run smoothly (and I talk about character recognition, not image generation or other things).
It's because we saw a boom in GPU power, and then shader, being twisted to do generic operations, that neuronal networks stated to become doable.

And humanity? Well something's needs to be done cause if no person is needed to work no person makes money and no person has money to spend so no company can stay afloat.

Atlas is a research robot, with no AI, it is all preprogramed, and worst of all, it uses hydraulics for movement. the reason why that sucks because hydraulics are notoriously hard to mass produce, and maintain. and even Boston Dynamics themselves said they would never mass produce Atlas.

Tesla bot has eclectic actuators, an already mass produced item, the robot also seems to be MADE specifically with mass production in mind. that's why you will probably get a tesla bot first.

*Session With GPT-4
Question: What do you think about this statement as if in the future the morality would dissapear and AI with robots mostly dominate the workers class?

Answer Generated by GPT-4:This statement reflects a bleak view of a future where materialism reigns supreme and robots replace human workers. If society becomes solely focused on materialistic pursuits and the accumulation of wealth, it could lead to a devaluation of human life and a disregard for moral considerations. In such a scenario, the well-being and dignity of individuals may be compromised in the pursuit of profit and efficiency.

The increasing use of AI and robots in the workforce could indeed lead to a situation where human workers are marginalized and potentially sacrificed for the benefit of a few who hold power and ownership over these technologies. This highlights the importance of addressing ethical considerations and ensuring that technological advancements are used to enhance human flourishing rather than diminish it.

As we navigate a future where AI and robotics play an increasingly prominent role in the workforce, it is crucial to consider the implications for society as a whole. Maintaining a strong moral compass and prioritizing human values in the development and implementation of technology will be essential to creating a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

I believe now is the best time ever to actually seriously consider implementing the UBI system in societies, as the Work-Automation will increase and boom in the next years (Especially for low and repetitive one-action jobs, which is a good thing)
but that also means lack of labor will further increase and poverty will increase as well
- It will make Huge markets and companies viewed as heroes for the community as they'll help the country and the UBI system, rather than viewing them as selfish money hoarders that don't share with anyone
- And it won't discourage people from working or looking for jobs, if they don't wanna' work, so be it, but if they can work, they'll have the salary adding with their UBI to live further than just ""getting the necessities for living"".
And Alot of people will actually look for work rather than staying home, as for some like myself it gives them a sense of purpose in life, and compared to some countries like mine where you actually need 2 jobs to get a decent life, but also can't have any free time for your loved ones and doing the things you like and looking after your health and explore new experiences, it's a waaaay better alternative to just work one job with the UBI system

We are not at the point where this technology is already replacing entire teams.

I've been following this stuff since 2001-2 when it was brought up in college, and I've been saying for a looooong time that this is coming, and been told over and over that it is over-hyped. But it's not. It is just getting started. And the next decade or two are going to be... Interesting.
The social shift here in the US is going to be particularly brutal. We have a lot of old school judo-Christian ethics of things like needing to earn your keep, needing to be a contribution to society, etc while downplaying the whole eat the rich and render to Caesar that which is Caesars aspect. But we also have the monster of efficiency aspect of things here which will absolutely override all of that and implement this stuff at full tilt as soon as it is economical to do it.
These two sides are going to be a difficult social change to contend with. So many people are going to be jobless with communities that are less than understanding and just telling bums to get jobs. Lots of people (myself included) hold a lot of our self worth in our ability to provide for our families... That isn't going to be a fun transition for me, but seeing it coming should help a little I hope.
The other massive issue is the economic shift this is going to make. Deployment of the robots will be expensive and inflationary. Companies are going to go massively into debt to push these deployments and stay ahead of the competition... But once the initial rollout is done and production is separated from work effort, it will be followed by massive deflationary forces. If labor is cheap and automated, mostly costing electricity which gets cheaper as we deploy renewable and break away from volitile costs of fossil fuels, and if a large portion of people have little to no income... Well... Deflation time. Consumers will not have much cash, so costs will have to come down.
Deflation isn't all bad. Every dollar you have becomes more effective and efficient, so building any wealth at all before deflation happens will be important to maintaining some form of wealth after... But in a debt based society where large companies go into debt to push out automation, and then trying to pay debts off in a deflationary system... Yeah... That is a massive and awful debt trap. I am personally in that trap myself right now having gone into some home debt to spend on higher grossing assets elsewhere. As long as we are in an inflating economy that is fiscal responsibility. But I will need to make sure to get that paid down well before the economy switches direction. I think we have a few years yet, so I'm not horribly worried... But it is something to keep an eye on.

I think the plus side though is that once we get through the next decade or two, things will genuinely get better. I expect a while where there is a ton of unemployment with little to no social supports... But after things transition, I think human beings will have a lot more flexibility of when they work, what kind of work they do, and how long if their life they choose to work vs other persuits. But that fiscal and social transition... I'm not expecting that to look pretty. üòÖ",0

Educated people are afraid because they know it will serve capitalism and increase drastically inequality. 
These robots are cool, but they are useful for humanity if humanity was living in a proper socialist economy. It does not. 
Capitalism requires you to have money and spend it. Therefore, universal basic income (UBI) will necessarily be introduce by the system. 
If we have UBI as it is define right now, you would see a decrease in life conditions, because most people (even 3 digits earnings people now) would just lose their jobs and not be able to get a new one. However, it would make poor people disappear. 
The issue is that very rich people will stay, and still be an issue for this planet. And they would become more powerful, as they would be the owners of our own living system. 

And don‚Äôt get me started on the workforce issue. They say they will lack workforce, but humanity does not lack that. The companies‚Äôs owner do.
Thinking unlimited growth is possible is naive and stupid, promised to doom us. And we create a more efficient, circular system to save ourselves from our ecological demise, then you would not need that many people.

Honestly, a movie like I Robot, where every human lives like in 2002 and have a robot is technically impossible. It does not make sense. 
I‚Äôm a very fierce believer of having an high UBI, so that humans can now do what they want instead of wasting 50 years of their life working, but this needs a big change of our current systems before.

Honestly all of these demos look a bit fishy to me.

I think GenAI will fail to get these things actually working, because all they're doing is stacking neural nets on very basic controllers/stabilizers which don't model physics well, and generative AI has shown its propensity to hallucinate shit. Learning the physics of interaction is very nontrivial and expensive (lots of out of distribution events, lack of appropriate function classes for learning very nonsmooth dynamics...) even if you have an accurate simulator, and especially if you're trying to train everything at the same time.",25

However, I have some serious doubts that they will be implemented in an altruistic capacity. The irony of it all is that companies will undoubtedly try to make their labor costs cheaper by sacking human workers for robots, yet with the population of the world only increasing, this will lead to a catastrophic disparity between those who can afford the basic necessities of life and those who cannot. Ultimately, this will cause major companies to fail as well since no one can afford to buy the products without having those jobs and will plunge the human race into utter chaos. Therefore, we cannot move forward with any more robotic technology without first taking a long, hard look at how we transact with one another first.",1

The enthusiasm and drive for innovation are commendable, but it's crucial to temper expectations with a dose of reality.
