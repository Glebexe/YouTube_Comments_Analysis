52,"Don’t know how much you know about WWII aviation history, but I guess most American know a very well-known American Volunteer Group (AVG) back in 1940s made many Aces, this fighter aircraft group was called “The Flying Tigers”. They were also best recognized as shark fang battalion in the air because of their vicious symbol in front of every P40 fighters. I bring up this piece of old history here is because they were stationed there fought together along with Chinese against Japanese imperialism invasions in the Second World War. I believe Kunming city established a museum few years back in memory of those AVG during this Sino-American war time cooperation. If you are still around in Kunming city, then why not pay a visit to that Flying Tiger Museum. Few years back, a few last living AVG Flying Tigers fight pilots and ground crew members were also returned there, too. Maybe it could be one of great tourist destinations for a one day visiting. Check it out then….

I have never been there before, but I will visit it in near future. Below is the website and its location in Kunming:

392,"我是西安人，欢迎你来西安旅行，并祝你玩的愉快！其实花椒不一定非得是“四川花椒”，中国很多地方都种植花椒。陕西有很多花椒品种，非常好的品质，西安的花椒大部分来自于韩城和渭南等地。
回民街的食物和汉族的食物并没有什么区别，回民街有的，基本上西安每个地方都有。
实际上，回民街的穆斯林美食都来自于汉族，比如：凉皮（你说的冷面条）都是来自于陕西汉族传统美食，并不是来自于中东。中国西北食物和中东本来就很相似，因为一千年前的“丝绸之路”，将中国和中东、中亚紧密的联系在一起，互相影响。另外北方人以面食为主，比如很多饼（类似于馕Nang)并不是来自于中东，这是中国北方人的传统中国北方人也很早就种植了小麦。由于中国移民大多数来自于广东和福建，西方人认识到的中国都是吃米饭的，但事实上并不是如此。中国食物和文化有太多的多样性。南北方差异非常大，如果不是普通话，互相听不懂😅，北方的老一辈人，比如我的太爷爷一辈子没吃过米饭，也没见过大米，只有小米，在她生活的那个年代，她很早就去世了…",51

401,An Australian client of mine actually asked me after traveling to Xi'an: Why are there so many Muslims there? Doesn't the Chinese government not allow religious belief? Then I could only tell him helplessly that the number of Muslims in China is almost equal to the population of Australia. Many Western media blatantly lied but no one could expose them. Perhaps this is why they don’t want people to travel to China and want to ban TIKTOK.,2

526,"I’m a Shanghai local and I’ve been living in SH for 22 years. Here are some local untouristy places I recommend for second-time visit travelers(if you want to live like a local):

Lanling Flower and Bird Market 岚灵花鸟市场 (highly recommended! Packed, a market selling pets and potted plants, you can even see small stores selling aquariums); 

University Road 大学路 at night (recommended! There are a lot of young people there); 

A city walk along Suzhou Creek from the Four Row Warehouse四行仓库 to the Henan Road Bridge 河南路桥 (better at sunset);

M50 Park (an art graffiti park, if you’re an art person you will def like it); 

Zhujiajiao and Qibao town. 朱家角&七宝古镇 in the suburbs, usually a weekend trip for SH locals.Try a strawberry picking experience in winter and early spring!

If you want to choose a restaurant through an app, you can download 大众点评.It has ratings and reviews for every restaurant😊

If you wanna be even more local, try the recreations: 

Onsen center 🛀(need to be naked in the public male/female pools😂); 

Private SPA and foot massage 💆; 
role-playing drama(English ones are only available in Shanghai, highly recommended!) ; Shanghai Disney

Feel free to ask me more if you are planning to visit!",0

533,"Very high quality video. Appreciate it as a Chinese🇨🇳. But I wanna correct one thing you mentioned by the end of the vlog about traveling here makes you feel disassociating with Internet Economy and having a life before the Internet. It is totally delusion or wrong perception, just cuz you don't know what's the replacing app of Google Map or other apps in China. Indeed, the online economy is the most advanced and dominating part in this country, 95percent of we citizens have to check the rating point of the restaurants, shops, hotels and hotspots we wanna go before we leaving home. However, it is quite normal for foreigners holding misunderstanding towards Chinese economy. all in all, thanks for advertising all stunning part of my country, really appreciate that! and as the local, my advice is all vlogs you filmed right now is a little bit superficial.. that will be perfect if you can study and absorb more economic and political  knowledge/ history of this ancient land, then the video gonna be more enlightening for audiences. love and peace .~ keep on moving on. respect",0

In China, there are a few other popular map apps that you might find useful. 高德Gaode Maps and 百度Baidu Maps are both widely used and offer features similar to Google Maps.
If you're looking to order food delivery, there are also a few popular apps in China. 饿了么Eleme and 美团Meituan are two of the most popular options. They offer a wide variety of restaurants to choose from, and you can usually get your food delivered within 30 minutes .
Finally, if you're looking for recommendations on things to do or places to eat, you can check out 大众点评. It's a Chinese app that offers user reviews of restaurants, attractions, and other businesses.

777,Hi Doug! Great to see you visiting China! Hope you enjoy yourself there. I have some suggestions for the map part. Typically google map doesn't work in China. But in China people use Baidu Map or Gaode Map which have the same functions like the google map. (I'm not sure whether these apps have the English version in their settings.) And inside these apps people can review the stores and places exactly the same as google map. Maybe you can try them. Good luck!,0

That place is called Cheng Huang Miao 城隍廟 or the City God Temple area, with the Nine Turned Bridge (Zigzag Bridge) Jiu Qu Qiao 九曲橋 that leads into the Yu Garden.  

Chinese use their own national brands of apps, such as Baidu instead of Google, Baidu Map instead of Google or Apple Map, Bilibili and Youku instead of YouTube, Weibo and WeChat (Weixin) and Douyin (Chinese version of TikTok) instead of other social media’s.  China has their own Beidou GPS system.

1731,"You went alone to Baghdad, were welcomed by simple-hearted Iraqis, and filmed a video in the CBP room without any restrictions from the officers! FYI, last December, I tried the same thing but was stopped and insulted by the rude and bullying officers there while me and my family who suffered were just waiting hours for a visa form to fill to apply for a visa for my son! 
The Iraqi people's attitude of double standards is just a long story to tell, as an American citizen of Iraqi origin as I is not a good point to get a warm and friendly welcome like you!
At Baghdad International Airport, my family and I were astonished by the mistreatment there, even  our Iraqi documents do not help us pass. As I mentioned before, they tried to take my cell phone from me when I filmed a very short video there. I was not allowed to get it back unless I delete those seconds that were recorded. Outside in the parking lot I found a mafia of drivers, each of them tried their best to charge us more money just to take us to an area close to the airport! 
Hotels in other cities have charged twice more than the regular prices they charge foreign visitors like you, and are serving me and my family poorly!
In short, I want to tell you that the Iraqi people are very kind and generous people as you have seen yourself but it is not the same with their people who hold American passports or any foreign passports, although you can be a spy disguised as a YouTuber and pretend that you like The Iraqi people but they treat you better than us.",0
