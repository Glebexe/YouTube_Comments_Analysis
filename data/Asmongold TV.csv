2,"Making a ravenous fan base hell bent on democracy and freedom, then trying to force a restrictive and unfair policy on said fan base.. not a great move, Sony.",0
3,they start with account mandatory and next subscription to access their server to play online :) its a tactic for a long game scam,0
4,Lol you know a studio has amazing faith in their game when they actually tell players to review bomb their own game for the betterment of the community. Im going to buy another warbond.,0
5,was funny seeing the quirky and arrogant CEO tweets turn sad,0
6,How can I refund the game?,0
7,One of the best things about helldivers is its lack of predatory corporate influence. Of course the helldivers community won't even let anyone get a toe in the door without fighting to protect this beloved game and would rather stop playing their favorite game to fight this influence. It's kinda poetic.,0
8,people need to understand that the devs aren't selling the game. Sony is.,0
9,195 countries total...wtf in all heck was Sony thinking with that one.,0
10,"43:39 factssssssssssssssssssss hahahaha~ just use this video and your last video and the community success of walking it back currently as a info real for any politician. they may not get it, but your very understadnable and id say worth the 3 hours",0
11,CHEEEEEERS!!! HAHAHAHA  i loved the recapp of everything in the first round of wild but  ASO GLAD YOU DID MORE COVERAGE!  first tyime people had a community to rally nad its been massive im so happy cause yeah they really screwed up doing this over a silent weekend lmfao. glad we have succeeded and that its a complete uno reverse but a couple vids from ya is a good hour of history archiving and i enjoy this watching time,0

15,"Sony backed down from the mandatory psn account link (with a tweet on May 6th), but the region lock is still here. And, even if people assume it will be lifted, there has been absolutely no communication about it's removal. So maybe players celebrated a little too early, I mean the players that got a refund because of the psn ""update"" and who, now,  can't buy their game back surely aren't celebrating.",0
16,"I think Steam going out and accepting these refund requests was the tipping point for Sony. They probably have been some discussions between Sony and Valve about this whole shitshow. Whenever it appears clear that Valve would have not supported Sony in this, it's no wonder why they lifted this requirement.",0
17,"Just wanna add this in there.  Arrowhead creates this amazing war game. The vast majority of folks I play with are veterans of actual war. Then the publisher comes along and wants to go to war with these same folks.  I don’t actually comprehend how they thought they would win. We kill bugs and robots. A bunch of guys in suits, don’t really scare us all that much. Suck it Sony.  Let this be a lesson to you.  We dive together or not at all.",0
18,"If this game is distributed in Poland, their law says that you cannot make changes after the launch that negatively impacts the game making it unplayable. This was used on cyberpunk and CD Projekt Red had to pay 10% of their revenue.  Imagine Sony being fined 10%.  CD Projekt Red  was fined 30 million the first time.  The second time it was sealed)",0
19,The only thing that made them backtrack was Steam breaking their own refund policy. Sony and Arrowhead couldn't have cared less otherwise.,0
20,"really nice video, the yt short which got made out of the part around 52:00 didn't make much sense without the context of this video",0
21,"The Gaming Community won this battle... Yet really the War is ongoing, so stay Strong Folks... with this sh*t tho:

I just felt I should add... kinda in defense of the devs, as it wasn't their choice to mandate PSN in the first instance... 
@ 9:44... when Asmongold showed the Devs response to an irate person: Where the Dev stated he knew about PSN months before launch and advocated/chose to disabled it at launch...

The context that's missing here is that PSN was always in the weeds of Steams sales page... but the PSN linking req was disabled at launch because of the Insane wave of purchases & success/influx of players that the game had at launch!

If they hadn't disabled it, it would have been like a Wow Expansion a decade ago... or last exp... lol.. I.E Connection errors Galor... 

If anything this goes to show that most people don't read any of the requirements that they're agreeing to... If the game works and plays, Amazing... if not refund... 

Whilst I agree with the above; The issue with all of this is that the implementation of this restrictive PSN linking is happening well after the fact... past the time of ""easy"" refunds for most... and against PS own blurb on their site... and its PS thats mandated this!

I'm just thankful that PS have at least a couple sharp ppl in the mix, and they managed to get through to the idiots they work with, within a week or so... 
Resulting in PS removed the PSN linking requirement... 

Just to spell it out... None of this was the Devs choice! The Devs got PSN disabled initially due to the influx of people playing... it was PS that wanted to re-enable it, once the servers could keep up..

And thankfully Democracy Won!!

Time to go back to Bug Slaying ppl!! :)



[Edit] Continuing to watch... @~19:00... Alot of what I just said above was referenced &/or implied by Asmongold... and I agree 100% the Devs were just Reacting to a Huge influx of players (above and beyond expectations... one of the few times this is ""Fair"" to say) by disabling PSN linking...

Sony told the Devs to implement the PSN linking in the first instance & essentially are also responsible for the Devs advising the playerbase that PSN linking would be restored.

[2nd Edit] @27:00 If it wasn't already obvious; Asmongold is very intelligent & extremely good at analyzing the facts of a situation!

[3rd and last edit... Surly Nothing can top this!] @32:42+ Asmongolds analysis just Tickled me silly... To Sum it up: Console Owner & Publisher... Ventures out into the Wild West of the PC Market and Learns a Hard Lesson!

27,"I have a feeling that Sony FUCKED the helldivers developers on a technicality. And because of a non-disclosure agreement, they are disallowed to share this.. This is sad :(
Guess we'll know more later.",1
28,"Sony should have made sure that it was only available to certain countries on steam from the start. It doesn’t matter that the developers turned off the account linking. If a game is intended from the start to have account linking that would prevent certain people from playing it, it should not have been purchasable. Companies need to take everything into account, and Sony did not. Allowing Steam to sell it to everyone along with having misleading info on there website puts them at 100% fault. I know that the developers are claiming some responsibility, but I think that Sony’s inability to ban sales in certain countries is the major overarching problem. You can’t allow someone to purchase your game and have full intent to take it away from them.",0
29,Asmon can you please collab with Styxhexenhammer666? Would be epic. Seriously.,1
30,Finally we have OUR OWN GAMER FLAG (see my avatar) :),0
31,I play Warframe with Playstation players and FFXIV with Playstation players without signing into a Playstation account,0
32,"It sounds like the SEO didn't want this link thing to start with and was forced to do it. He gave Sony an excuse saying something like ""it messes up the servers we can't implement it now, but we can get it in later.""
Sony was ""sure, you got half a year.""

In the back of his mind I'm sure he knew this was going to cause a shit storm and Sony would have to back down.",1
33,Its actually insane to me how big wig execs are so out of touch with their own industry that they make massive blunders like this when the solution is SO simple like Asmon said. Make it voluntary and so you get a bonus for doing it. Us gamers are not hard to please with this kind of stuff,0

37,"On SteamDB the night before the backtrack I added it up to just shy of 350,000k negative reviews. I mean like less than 50 away from the 350k mark. It was real bad for them lol. 
Fight still isn't over yet, though. The game still isn't available in the countries where PSN is not available.",0
38,"developer was actually smart - he said ""please change your review and it will help us"" even though their intial response was a bit trasheesh. they must been pressed by sony at first to make user comply but now we have spoken~! sony probably realized it would be better legally to make this decision.",0
39,The battle has been won! Real-world order Operation CLEAN UP is a go! Time to reverse the negative Steam reviews to support the developer and community's victory over Sony!,1
40,Don't force people to do shit that never ends well. How dumb are these companies lol,0
41,"Sony forcing PS3 customers to update and remove other OS or not be able to play any future games to prevent people who have equipment costing thousands of $ that may with a bit of luck be able to occasionally hack the console. then the console getting hacked wide open easily in response, and the entire PSN network taken down, massive data breach and proof that Sony was using pirated software themselves. That was the biggest of all fuck up and why I never trust Sony and won't buy their consoles unless I can hack them and so not give Sony a penny (buying the console second hand of course).",0
42,"TODAY, I was looking over the negative reviews that are still on Steam, and it appears that they're still over 170+ countries that are still locked out of the game and can not play. Everyone is reverting their negative reviews too early! Sony has no intentions of removing this even though they claim to me reversing psn link requirements. We have to get the word out to more and spread the news to all the players!",1

49,"As a PS5 HD2 player, ive seen tons of PS gamers going to bat for the PC gamers. I too agree with that sony was wrong. But why does it feel like this guy is just ripping on console users? I play console because im technologically impared and dont have the money to keep up a decent PC. So that makes me a fanboy diserving this talk? That doesn't seem right. There were many others that were thinking the same way i was about this sony crap. This isnt PS hating on PC. This is a minority of toxic assholes making us look bad.",1
50,I love that 1 day was all it took for asmongold from saying 12 people will leave over this to people will talk about this fuck up forever lmfao,0
51,Sometimes I wonder why sony distribute playstation consoles in countries that doesn't have psn support. Like why bother? Then most people from those countries has to give fake information just to access the console and now Sony made a rule about any fake information means termination of that persons account like what do u want them to do?😂,0

Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: nProtect GameGuard
Requires 3rd-Party Account: PlayStation Network (Supports Linking to Steam Account)
Requires agreement to a 3rd-party EULA
HELLDIVERS™ 2 EULA

Still a requirement when you purchase you still have to agree to it all Sony has done is delayed its plans",0
54,this was a publicity stunt,0
55,"Sony could have get away with ""Hey you ! Link your PSN Account and get these FREE ITEMS !! Come on what are you waiting for""

then they would have most of the pc playerbase linking their psn accounts. Simple give-give situation that would be fair and effective",1

62,"For those who say Pilestedt is lying about them knowing, I smell a rat.

If you don't know, Japanese companies have a horrible notorious habit of throwing their underlings under the bus. In some contracts, you, as the talent or worker under the corporations, might have the responsibility of apologizing to the public as yourself, not behalf of the company. This belief is recently renewed by a similar notorious black company, Nijisanji in Selen's Drama of being terminated from the company. You can see yourself at Legal Mindset's Nijisanji contract review. I forgot at one point but if you're willing to go through the entire VoD, you'll eventually find it. You suddenly see 3 Nijisanji talents making a serious video about the drama instead of the company. I feel like this is exact the same thing. Sony told Pilestedt to apologize publicly and take ""part"" of the blame. Coz think about it, Asmongold said his statement doesn't make sense. And he's right. Why would Sony still sell to non-PSN regions? Pilestedt saying he knew this and still sold it doesn't make sense and at the same time, doesn't answer the question. Okay Pilestedt, you knew? Why did Fraud still take place? Occam's Razor still suggests that this was a haphazard decision made by Sony. Not only does it explain the cause, but it also makes sense. So did Pilestedt volunteered? Or voluntold?",0

Not only that, but they try to irrationalize people who refuse to eat it, ""Giant corpo made this sh*t for you to eat, so stop complaining!"". It's like those dog owners who feed their dog Alpo every meal, instead of actual food, and they wonder why the dog diarrheas all over the house.",1

Everyone blew this way out of proportion. But I will say, it was good of steam and the developer of the game to have the communities back on this one.",0
70,Sony is literal garbage ever since they changed PSN price and made it into multiple tiers they showed their true gluttony as if having best selling console wasn’t enough,0
71,"Would love it if this was arrowheads plan all along they hated the idea of it being mandatory so they fake a server issue to sony so they get the red light to turn of it being mandatory to plag the game so they get everyone on the game and fighting  under one banner for a singular cause and drop the bombshell leading to everyone telling sony to shove their shit,

To me another motive (other than data farming) i can see for sony doing this is to make it harder for xbox to get the game",0

73,You don't need an ID in UK,0
74,"People always say ""They had to do it because of the contract,"" but have we seen the contract?

He and/or his company signed the contract. They didn't think much of this or care. Judging by the original responses, they signed the contract and would have *WANTED* this. They weren't forced into it. They did it willingly and happily because it would have benefited them and made things easier for them. They'd have one CS system to deal with instead of two and probably other benefits.

The fact that some players can't access PSN or that many players would simply be against it for whatever reason probably never even crossed their mind at all.

Even the initial announcement or CM response about it didn't convey any reluctance at all about it. Only ""This existed from the start, but something was broken (probably some backend issue). We fixed it, so we're turning it on.""

The whole ""SEI made them do it"" was assumed and started by the community. The Devs and CMs ran with it later. They were *NEVER* forced into it. That's not how game development and contracts work.

If the devs were against it from the start, they could have taken care of it before the contract was even signed and/or before they made the announcement that started all of this. It would have saved them a lot of development resources.",0

Games that go this far into the red are tarnished.
Regarding why Sony did this: If they push everyone onto PSN it opens a door for them to launch their own Playstation PC Client like xbox game pass, but the problem is that they went about it all wrong. 

The difference between big companies and small ones is that big corporate ruins everything with status quos. Look at Twitch for example. Everything was great, then they had to make their annual quota so they ""had"" to add commercials. No they didn't. CEOs wanted to gold line their already filthy rich pockets. Now how do they make that money spike again this year? When someone ends stream and you were lurking if you come back to it you will still see commercials and then, oh yeah! surprise they are not streaming anymore but you had to watch an extra commercial. It increased that annual income once again. Now they have increased the amount that a sub costs by $1 in Canada. I can only speak for Canada because I don't know how they are managing it in other countries. but that's to hit status quo once again. They are making it worse and worse. What's wrong with Twitch making 1 Billion one year and instead of increasing it just making 1 billion again. To them it's a problem because they are not increasing it, but at the end of the day that is such a stupid amount of money already that they can afford to just not go for that increase. It's corporate greed that fucks up companies. If their money drops from the status quo down to 1 billion a year they will close the doors on it because they are not making MORE even though it isn't REALLY losses. It's all gains when you make that much money.",0
230,"Look, I think it's good that Sony did this, and I know that they said they heard gamer feedback (and I'm sure they did), but I don't think Sony undid this decision because of 'gamer feedback.' Valve (that's Steam) delisted the game in over 180 countries. They did this, because in those countries, PSN account could not be made. That means, that even though the game was purchasable in those countries, it wasn't playable. That amounts to selling a defective product, and they didn't want to be on the receiving end of a lawsuit, and _that_ is why Sony didn't go through with this, because their biggest distributor for the game basically said 'we won't be middle-man to this scam of yours.'

And if you think Arrowhead cares, or that their CEO is based just because he said he was against PSN linking from the beginning, have a look at their community managers and the insane things they said and did, like banning Mark Kern's name from the Discord, or publicly voicing support for the PSN linking so they could more easily ban people; there's no way the CEO of Arrowhead _doesn't_ know about those statements, there's no way he doesn't know that at least some of his CMs are communists, but those people _aren't_ going to get fired.

Overall, still a good thing, still a win for managed democracy, just remember who you're dealing with when you play that game, and keep your guard up in case they try any funny shit in the future.",0

Taking the time to keep us up-to-date and informed on situations, giving your opinion, and dealing with all of the nonsense—you have our appreciation. With that being said, let's get to the topic at hand. I've been thinking about it for the last two days: Why would Sony do this? It makes no sense why they would kill this game like this. The only thing I can think of is that they see how much of a success it is. None of these players—those playing this game—are tied to the PlayStation Network. In contrast, Xbox has all of their games available on PC, and many of those players are tied to the Xbox network. This is because you can access Xbox games through Game Pass. Perhaps Sony wants to compete and wishes to have all of those players tied to their network. They could then use them to demonstrate how many new subscribers they've gained this year. Does that make sense? What do you think?",0

A for the people title. And then Sony came in, and pulled some AAA shit.

They let the devs market the game as a kind of middle finger, to the big titles that have been bending people over for the past decade, and then came in after massively successful marketing campaign, and moved the goalpost. 

I dont think the community liked the game so much that they're bent out of shape over having to give Sony their e-mail address and it is ruining a GOTY, they're bent out of shape because the reason they loved the game was what it stood for symbolically, and Sony made a liar of arrowhead. It would be like learning that your local restaurant that you've been supporting because you want the people in your town to be successful was secretly owned and franchised by Wendy's, and then being told - hey we cant give you the wing-wednesday discount until you sign up for the Wendy's rewards program.

283,"so in short... Months before the game is going to launch, sony already asked the devs to make account linking mandatory
but because some error happens during launch the devs disables account linking and makes it not mandatory TEMPORARY.
this makes it looks like the devs fked it up

HOWEVER the issue is SONY as the PUBLISHER, sells the games on countries that can't access PSN
so at the end of the day it's still sony's fault as the publisher for selling the game on countries that can't access PSN for the steam version",0
284,"From an Objective business perspective in a mindset of being a business owner of a construction company that installs guardrails etc. having knowledge of people needing to create an account for Sony, and not realizing that players who are in non Sony supported countries will get screwed over if they buy the game, it wouldn’t even have crossed my mind, because I would be focusing more on the game working smoothly, and finally getting a 8 year project to be published. There are many things that I have overlooked, because at the time it was bought up, I misinterpreted what was mentioned due to the lack of information. So when Sony said that people will have to link accounts to PSN in order to play, I would’ve thought that Sony would do the right thing, when it comes to distributing the game for purchase.

Also another thing that we have to factor in is that most small businesses that scored a contract with a large ass multi million/billion dollar company/industry, your job as a CEO is to make sure that the quality doesn’t get below 100%, and now they can start to concentrate, or implementing what you had planned ahead, if all goes well.

Also the CEO based on how he acts as a person on all other YT streamers that were invited to play with the CEO/Dev on public matches to see how others reacted to the game, and how this game actually started out as an actual joke. You can tell that these guys still have a solid moral compass and integrity. They aren’t tainted by the greed, and have an army of lawyers that will work with their PR to do damage control. Honestly, if people don’t want their info be given out to Sony, etc. you might as well wipe all of your digital fingerprint, and never log onto the internet at all.

Read all the TOS for every site that you create an account, you surrender everything that you type/upload, and nothing you do will ever be private, lol. Companies that aren’t great at corporate espionage, they contract outside help to buy your information, and will send you an email with a sale you won’t pass up to hook, line, and sinker all of your information, lol.

You didn't buy the pea soup from Knorr, but from the grocery store. You didn't buy Helldivers from SIE, but from Steam. Steam was liable for making the sales in places where the game can't be played, not SIE.

The audience was not left well aware, and you can say that's sonys fault, but to pass zero blame to the developers when they had every ability to say it, is crazy. They sold their soul you know. This situation is Sonys fault, but there was little to no communication on arrowheads end, so it just pisses me off people wanna act like they're just caught in the crossfire. They learned from this, you know? To say they didn't fuck up is to say they ain't learn shit. Both publisher and developer had access to the same info.

Microsoft did this with Minecraft but they had like a message that ""you will require Microsoft account to play 3 months from now"", I remember. Also most of the players already had Microsoft account and Microsoft bought the game so it made sense to people that they will require different account because they are now playing a game from different company. Also you only needed Microsoft account now to play and not Mojang account which made it less complicated to play the game for some people like me.

1-arrowhead knew that ONLINE playstation games had to be linked to psn network (but even sony doesnt have this very clear on there won website so even though they want this they dont have it in writing they actually have the opposite in writing and should of been changed a long time ago if they did not want that to be the case)
2- arrowhead having the ability to control servers and the coding of the game got permission to disable linking to psn so the launch would go off better and overlooked how important of a issue this would be as sony did not communicate this to steam when contracting steam to sell the game as sony is in charge of distribution either they did not communicate to steam that psn network was a requirement and therefore shouldnt be sold to countries that cannot link to psn OR steam fucked up and didnt make it to where those people couldnt buy the game one of those two happened no one is looking at steam here as if there was something on steam saying that psn would be required they are the ones that sold it on there platform after being contracted by sony to sell it on the steam platform
3- the people who bought the game AFTER psn link was disabled were not aware of the future psn mandatory lnk to psn unless they stumbled upon it so when the word got out from the helldivers post stating it was coming the majority of the player base thought that this was a surprise gotcha  now that the game is big im gonna force you into some other bullshit when that is not really the case
4- the community attacked sony and helldivers and steam so hard on a false allegation that sony actually said fuck it its not worth the trouble let them play without it.

i dont think people actually understand what just happened here we won yes but we won under false allegations somewhere some people fucked up and didnt word things properly or overlooked old statements on their websites sony didnt update that page for years even though they were operating under different views than what was still up on the website thats where sony fucked up unless they fucked up on working with steam for distribution or if thats steams fault we may never know bur other than that sony didnt surprise jump anyone with anything all online sony games required psn up until now helldivers will be the only one. arrowhead fucked up by not creating a pop up after disabling the psn requirement making this very clear for all players and i think personally steam fucked up by selling the game to countries not able to link to PSN as sony contracted them to sell the game and apparently it was on steam saying psn was required. this storm of issues made it look like something that it never was and the community attacked on those views turns out they were all wrong

Whenever people bitch about reviewboming it's always on some fucking topic/product/fandom/entertainment they don't care about themselves. People who actually care about the product voices their opinion here, all the others do is budge in with their irrelevant disinterest and even disdain for what used to be good and celebrating it's destruction just because idfk, I guess everything everywhere at all times has to be exactly tailored to just their singular ego?

Meaning this went from ""no one at Sony cares"" on Friday afternoon, to literally one of the first items on their agenda on Monday morning. We even got a cape to commemorate our victory. I hope we'll remember this for years to come. Not as an extreme failure, but as a victory. None of the other examples you listed ended up with a complete victory. But the Helldivers community finally beat the odds and won an immediate victory over Sony.

The devs were either dishonest or incompetent in this no matter how you look at it. He knew BEFORE release it was required and yet the game was sold in countries that did not allow PSN accounts and hence the players would be unable to play after purchase.

Sony is total shit now.   People haven't quite caught onto their Playstation store scam just yet,  and when they do, they will drop Sony guaranteed.   Sony is selling broken games on the store,  they also have the games set to auto capture upon start even if you have all your system settings to have it turned off. the games themselves or the psn force capture the game.   As soon as a game is captured via stream or anything you void any ability to refund the games.  They did this to me with call of duty,  the version was 4 years old and 100% non functional yet there it was for sale.  After I got it I realized immediatly upon start that nothing worked.  Went to get a refund and Sony said nope you streamed.  I said what the fuck you talking about I can't even get past the damn menu as the menus arnt even there short of settings.   They said sorry you streamed so no refund and hung up.   I googled the game and low and behold it's 100% broken due to the newer cod and they just fudge the old versions yet still sell them blatantly scamming people for money.   Also the game had no settings for capture or streaming and my ps5 was set to all off, no capturing anything. Since finding this out I've paid attention to the games I install and I've noticed they now all do this as soon as the game is installed and started it immediatly captures and removes any ability to get money back if the games shit or broken. Using extra I downloaded and tried at keast 50 games and they all force capture reguardless of settings so had i paid money i would be sol on getting refunds.
Playstation is turning into a scumpany and it's just sickening.  I've since sold the ps5 as I have no desire to be ripped off by a shit company.

George RR Martin's publishing company is Simon & Schuster.  If Simon & Schuster started sending out copies of Game of Thrones with book covers made from shards of glass and anthrax, I could see how people might get upset with George Martin, as the face of Game of Thrones.  Now, George might say ""Well, it's the publisher that handles that part of the business "", but the customer, rightfully so, doesn't care.  Why did George pick that publisher for his work?  Once the issue was known, why did George pull the deal?  Why did George greedily sign a contract with a publisher that didn't allow a legal way to break the contract due to gross negligence of the publisher?
If some f-up happens, as a consumer, I'm not going to be blaming the wholesaler, the warehouse storage facility, the distributor, or the retailer ... I'm blaming the creator.  And if that creator signed into a contract giving up the decision input in order to make more money, or get a deal to enter into a certain market ... I don't care.  It's their work product.

They changed from a 3rd person perspective to an over the shoulder camera, removed 75% of classes (going from 23 professions to 7), made all classes cookie cutters, and forced people to play a storyline quest instead of the sandbox it was released as. Players were told that SOE had no choice, and that it was all LucasArts' fault. However, when the changes happened and protests were abound, the SOE CEO John Smedley took sole credit for the changes. On top of that, he was arrogant enough to say that any loss of subscribers would be replaced with new subscribers and those who complained would not be missed.
Queue the exodus of 90% of the players and the shuttering of SOE.
Thankfully Sony has at least learned SOME lessons.",25

Or We are not your provider how should I know why your phone doesn't get service in some areas, or why your printer can't connect to your wifi as you didn't get the printer or the wifi from us so WTF are you asking me? 

Oh and just FYI though it wouldn't really help with stupid people. Don't leave negative reports with customer support on how your interaction went because of some company policy because it will have ZERO impact. This is because the Company doesn't read them, when a negative review happens the manager simply checks that the customer service person followed all the polices and assuming they did then just trashes the report. It doesn't go any higher up the chain so corporate doesn't see them as surveys are just tips for CS both in the sense on how to improve but also the service industry sense as bonuses are linked to how many positive surveys they get. Also most companies outsource their CS and the only impact it could have is the company hiring a new CS firm. 

Basically the company wants you to accept their BS and be happy about it. Negative reviews from CS just means their outsources CS firm isn't doing a good job spinning their BS so they shop around for another firm instead of fixing the issue.",1

This seems like a whole lot of people that didn't bother to read the fine print, and are now upset about it. It's fair to point out what Sonys FAQ says in contradiction to this situation, but not a single mother fucker probably knew that page existed, never crossed their mind, until now when they are looking for reasons to complain.

716,"Just to be clear 🤓 contrary to what I read here and there, Sony didn't target the game once it became successful. 
As shown in the ceo's tweet, it was already the case at launch, but in order to lessen the load on servers during that ectopic period, that ceo decided to temporarily disable this feature (among others like planets stats) in order to increase servers capacities. 
Although the most logical solution, it out the game in an awkward position when came the time to reactivate this feature as it should have stayed.
I hope he doesn't get into problems with it's publisher because the backlash that decision incurred.

For instance I wouldn't be surprised at all if they didn't know that many countries can't have a PSN account, I didn't know this until recently. And if I was the dev I would have just assumed that there was a built in exception for these countries. Why wouldn't Sony want to sell games to everyone?

Sure they knew, but their focus is on making games, not distributing games. If they were experts at distributing games they wouldn't have had Sony be the publisher. And after it was released and some people couldn't play I completely understand them removing the requirement thinking that Sony would come up with a solution to let everyone play.

I also kind of wonder if this is exactly what the CEO of Arrowhead was expecting and wanting. May have gotten to the point with Sony that he realized they were never going to solve the issue and were going to eventually push the linking forward.

If they made it optional that would still allow everyone to play the game just rhough steam log in.",0

They delisted all the countries which can't make PSN accounts (Which, you know, Sony /has/ this information. Sony is who Steam and other distribution platforms get this information from.) and then Delisted Japan as a personal FU to Sony.

I get why some folks feel AH holds some of the blame- ultimately, they are the face of the game even if Sony are the ones pulling the strings. They could have been more clear, they could have communicated better- many of the CMs have been kinda ranty about it recently which, I get it, they're a small team getting swamped by drama they weren't expecting, but it would have been better for them to have said nothing at all than some of the things they've been posting on twitter and the discord.

Ultimately, though, Sony are the ones who pushed the PSN, Sony are the ones who allowed the game to be sold in regions where they knew full well PSN accounts were not available. And it's been Steam and the Users providing Leverage for AH to negotiate with Sony on pushing this back. Steam's decision not to block review bombing, to lift their usual 2 hour limit on refunds has been an invaluable tool for us to hit Sony where it hurts- in the wallet.",0

I was annoyed about that for several days, but my friend wanted to play the game and it was fun, so I got over it.  Now I'm annoyed about it all over again.  That shouldn't have been necessary.  It should have just let me skip making and linking another pointless account.  I don't own any other Sony games and the most recent Play Station console I own is a PS2.  I don't want to make an account for every single thing.  These gaming companies have no chill when it comes to forcing you to use their accounts.

1222,"wrote this for my review:

I regret to say that my experience with Helldivers 2 has been overwhelmingly negative, to the point where I cannot recommend it to fellow gamers.

The primary issue plaguing my time with the game is its persistent crashing on PC. No matter what adjustments I make to settings or attempted fixes, Helldivers 2 continues to crash frequently, disrupting gameplay and causing frustration. It's incredibly disappointing to invest time and money into a title only to have it rendered virtually unplayable due to technical issues.

Additionally, I was taken aback by the requirement to connect to Sony's PSN, a platform I have no interest in and do not use. This forced integration with PSN feels like an unnecessary imposition on PC players and detracts from the overall experience. As a PC gamer, I expect the freedom to enjoy a game without being tethered to unrelated platforms.

Considering these significant flaws, I cannot in good conscience recommend Helldivers 2 to others. It's a shame because the concept and gameplay have potential, but these technical and design choices severely undermine any enjoyment that could be had.

Pros:

Interesting concept and gameplay mechanics.
Cons:

Frequent crashes on PC make the game virtually unplayable.
Forced connection to Sony's PSN is an unnecessary imposition on PC players' autonomy.
Verdict: Unless these issues are addressed and resolved, I advise potential buyers to steer clear of Helldivers 2.",0

I had mine on file with Walmart, and I used Walmart+ for a while(like their prime). When I visit their website now, since my subscription has run out, there's always a pop-up to offer me to resubscribe.

I accidentally hit the OK on it one day, and I'm really glad I just had my cashapp linked to it instead of my actual debit card, because it tried to charge me over $100 for an annual subscription, and only failed because I just didn't happen to have enough in my cashapp at that time.

So just off of one button from a front-page pop-up that I easily pressed on accident, over $100 was almost down the drain, coming with a new headache of trying to get the money back.

So now, I try to not keep those things on file if it's not for an active subscription. It gives companies a quick link to your wallet, on their terms, and like Asmon said that convenience makes it easier to decide to impulse buy shit you don't need",0

I've been a Sony guy since I was a kid in the 90s with a ps1, got every new console they came out with, even the PSP (not the Vita though cause lol) but I never once had an interest in getting the PS5. Ever since the PS3 launch, Sony has gone downhill in my eyes, in almost EVERY direction a company can go downhill in. Aside from the hacks, the PS3 console was a trainwreck of a launch, and I lost $200 in accessible features when they could no longer repair my backwards compatible version and gave me a version with less functionality and no partial refund. The PS4 wasn't much better as far as repair issues but at least it wasn't on the scale of the PS3, but my PS4 pro died exactly one day after the manufacturers' warranty expired, and even the ps2 had a few issues, so all in all I've had about 3 of each version of the console. While that's WAY less than the average 360 owner, its still way more than should happen to any consumer. Sony has offered less and less with each future generation, and the PS5 exists solely as a ""Demon's Souls Remastered"" emulator and now Stellar Blade. It's bittersweet, but Sony is officially over, we can all go home now.",0

That FAQ is different that the one you red yesterday which was already updated. Stop interpreting things as lies when it is probably simultaneous actions to prepare communications. You don't have a single button to coordinates everythings, some will be delayed to another. 

This community behaviour is somehow justified but it came to a point where it is comparable to a stalker... think about it.

We were probably more disapointed because of the fact it was talk that much. The review thing should have been a time for a break for at least 1 week.

They took only 1 day (maybe 2) after last video. And now another video is made already...
 I don't blame you, this is your job to talk about the news as they are in the moment, the video came just too late and now there's already a sony answer invalidating all of that video (the half I watched so far at least)

That's not to mention that pretty much every single Sony PC port uses Denuvo DRM protection making the PC versions actually inferior because they are heavily taxing on your hardware for no reason at all.

I really do wish people tried a bit harder to understand things before attacking people. Like the AH CEO definitely needs to be held accountable for his part... but he should never have to be held accountable for what the publisher does (IE Sony). The fact so many people blame him for sales of the game in places that psn isnt supported when he has literally almost nothing to do with it cause thats Sony's job as the publisher. Its just fucking wild. People always attack the dev studios when 90% of all the issues that piss them off were put in place by the publishers or other outside forces. I actually feel bad for the devs at AH... they never deserved this backlash... the CEO did a little but not near what he's had to deal with. Sony deserves it all and so much more. Cause they consistently pull weird shit like this. 

I really hope people change their reviews back to positive now that sony has backed off the psn requirements. Cause in all the game itself is absolutely a great game with a great dev studio behind it. They definitely didnt deserve to have to go through all this all weekend and we should do what we can to let them know we still love the game they worked so hard on for us. Cause make no mistake...

A real conspiracy theory though would be to think Sony made all this Drama to promote Helldivers 2 and make an example for the gaming industry.

I do believe arguing against a Corp with a fact like ""Restricting the countries by forcing PSN on the players will limit the potential marked on steam by x %""... Or at least something like ""Forcing people to sign up is frowned upon and will keep some players away, making it optional with some sort of reward could be taken better"" or what? He at least didn't laugh at customers like Spitz or others and took that bad move with humor...

It just seems very dubious to me.",0

So like when someone asked ""what do i do, since i live where there's no psn"" and the ceo could only answer ""i dont know"". he could try, like before answer ""dont buy it until you can play it"" but sony woudnt like to lose sales even if the player cant play the game, so he can't give us a straight answer, just like the cm's.",0

He made a call about turning off the account binding that wasn't really 'allowed', but the publisher and controller of the Steam page should 100% have ensured it could only be bought by correct countries. That account enabled or not shouldn't have impacted it as Sony mandated the account binding, meaning even if the game's internal system required a PSN account, Steam STILL would have sold the game to unapproved countries. The only thing that would have happened is it would have been safe to refund and the dev definitely screwed those people over thinking he was helping.

But, this still has a silver lining: Sony learned a lesson about messing with PC gamers. Either don't list their games at all, or respect our freedom of choice. Just like we don't pay to play non-subscription multiplayer games where Sony requires that on their consoles (which is so stupid, I bought a game and can play with people on PC - those people don't pay, but I have to pay $80 a year).",45

That essentially means Valve/Steam saw those negative reviews as legitimate. I'm happy we won and I hope that the community can get things back on the positive track they were on.

Yes it’s unfortunate and misleading what they did because not everyone can make a psn account. However, most the countries listed aren’t even places with power and clean water. I agree with selling a product to someone who can’t play at a latter date is bad. But I refuse to give into the ideology that psn accounts are a net negative. Fine, go away pc players.

1964,"(1/2 through the vid) I think one of the big things for Steam where they banned the  sale of the game in contries without PSN account access and also  why Sony could have back tracked on this is because if you went to Steams' website to  buy the game you do not see PSN account link required. Which may change how Steam structures their purchasing structure. So like me and probably many others it came as a shock. I am glad, that it looks like Sony Japan, after seeing the debocal  on the weekend decided to change it's course on this for the time being.

The biggest thing that Sony Entertainment will now have to deal with is cross server play because from my understanding the Sony ToS (for people who play on PS5) and the Steam ToS (for those who play on PC) are different. I could see this come back in another ""bad way""   where if you want to cross-play with people on PS5 you would have to link a PSN account which would complaicate things monsterously.

I think Sony should just keep to the PSN accounts not being needed and reap the rewards of publishing rights (though I do not know how much they make from that)",0
1965,Here's the sad thing. If the game just dies here and people don't play it anymore the lessons Sony gets is well this game is just not worth the investing for long term. They won't accept their own fault in it they'll find a different thing to excuse as the reason why. Because they want to put this in all of their games I am certain of it. So until multiple games fail because of it you're going to keep doing it,0

1978,Game was shit since day one. Bought it day one couldn’t even log in to play the damn game. Haven’t touched it since and never will again. Definitely won’t buy another game made by this company again. If a game is broken on release when I buy it I will NEVER buy anything from them again. Period. I’m tired of getting burned.,0

1987,"It’s seems that corpo greed comes with some instant karma. Especially when it involved something that didn’t need it. And for whatever reason Sony wanted to lock things down so that they had better numbers overall. Cause let’s face it. Console gaming is dying, People are moving over to pc. 
And if Sony got their head out of their ass and made an online portal that you could buy and play games without proprietary hardware. Then they’ll just lose money I guess. But pulling stuff like this will keep people from their services.",0

This game could work well because it's a lot of us that have disposable income to keep throwing at these war bonds to keep the game going, because we just enjoy playing it, and we just don't like crazy predatory crap like this.

2000,I stopped playing after they just rebooted the bots. How boring and lazy.,0
2001,"I still believe everyone is missing something here. The game dev CEO said he knew 6 months BEFORE launch that PSN linking would be required for multiplayer PS titles, and that it was HIS DECISION at launch to temporarily turn it off while they sorted out the servers. Then when they got it fixed they tried to turn it back on. It’s just as much HIS fault as it is Sonys fault. Sony is most at fault for allowing it to be sold in places that can’t make a PSN though. It is good to see they reversed the decision though. I still believe the developers are just at as much fault as Sony though, considering that the CEO knew 6 MONTHS BEFORE launch this was going to be mandatory.",0
2002,The guy just admitted to the world that they deliberately baited and switched.  Anyone who’s bought the game and canceled should file a complaint with their States Attorneys General.  Even Texas doesn’t allow this shit. They make Auto dealerships honor prices they post in Advertisements. It used to be they would have sales and only have one car available at the advertised price.a Second point is that this is a monopolistic tactic you can only buy products from the company store.,0
2003,"Its good they made a stand on this because you if let them get away with this time they’ll it’ll just get worse and worse. 
Unlike console players actually have the tools to fight back.",1
2004,"The whole problem is the disconnect between developers and players, the publishers are the middle man, developers want to take their time to make a good game so everything works properly and players enjoy it, BUT then you add the publisher and they only care about 2 things, money and deadlines, get it done as quick as possible, for as little as possible, that they have the final say, is the main problem, because they definitely dont have the player in mind",0
2005,"Glad it worked out in this case, but let's be honest.  This outcome is an anomaly,  I don't expect to see it repeated across other games.",0
2006,"Wasn't Star Wars: Galaxies a HUGE fuck up on Sony's part? I know it was SOE, but that was still OWNED by Sony at the time.",0

2015,"Probably still won't buy it, I'll just wait until the next good game to drop and hope that one won't piss on their customers.",0
2016,"Maybe because it is missing a comma and some emphasis.  ""I said(referring to what he said previously), We were asked to make 'mandatory account linking' 6 months before launch"".  It makes sense to me but my brain adds all of the punctuation.",5

2021,"It’s great that they reversed their decision. However, the requirement to connect to PSN was posted on the games steam page from day one. So….. yeah. People can’t read I guess. Also, the only reason why people are mad about this is cause won’t be available in certain countries?, I seriously don’t believe that people in at least the US care about this. Also, you CAN make a PSN account in a country it’s not available in but you’d have to put that you live in a different county. I used to do it all the time to see what the PS Store in Japan had.",0
2022,Obviously it was Asmons review on Steam that made them backtrack.,0
2023,This is the kind of thing that gets state's attorney generals calling Sony on the phone for customers complaints of consumer fraud.,0
2024,"i really didn't think this was a big deal from the start. A not thought through descision on Sonys part and bad communication over a weekend. This shouldn't destroy all the goodwill the devs have shown us. If the game dies, it is the players that killed it and not the Arrowhead or sony alone at least",0
2025,"Everyone claiming there was ""no requirement"" instead of ""technical issues prevented enforcing the requirement"" is being disingenuous.

2027,"One of the thing peoples forget. Is that sony made it clear that they will have theyre own store front and be able cut steam. They want you in theyre ecosystems the earlier possible. 

So they can cut the steam taxes.

Like activision did and ubisoft did. You gonna have a sony storefront.

Theyre clearly stated it in the end of the year",0

2034,"The Developer say's he didn't ""HANDLE"" the sales but they delegated the handling to a third party, surely? and in doing so ""Handled"" it

2046,"idk, people talk about GOG launcher like it's the same as ea or ubisoft or rockstar. it's not at all. GOG is better than steam in the fact you can download the installers and don't need to have an extra client running in the background to play the game",0

Just remember to always scan for malware and viruses before you install, and it is a bit of work if you want to be extra safe and monitor your internet activity and hosts, so your PC does not end up being used as a proxy by the torrent site (type netstat in cmd prompt). But at least I know I have my personal data safe... to bad the companies don't understand that, from my perspective it was better when you could order a CD/DVD with the game on it, install and play, all it asked for is the serial key when installed, and if they are afraid that it's to easy to pirate like that, just make a security software that needs the CD to run, that is paired with the install kit, witch asks you for a nick and password witch makes an account, that can only run the game in 1 instance at a time per account, and every account is made using the serial key, that is written on the CD. As it was a long time ago, or at least give us the alternative to buy the game without knowing who we are and where we live and sometimes even asking for our card details.",0
2100,If they didn't require a credit card I would be more likely to sign up. After the first big Sony hack in the early 10's I  lost $500 to a hacker. After the charges took place I had to bounce between layers of customer support for 8 months to get my money back.

2114,"Shame people cant see the bigger picture with stuff like this from the business law standpoint as this incident is just a symptom of much deeper issue. Why can't people see that these publishers/platforms have been arbitrarily changing their written contractual agreements with the consumer retroactively in spite of the laws of the countries they operate around the world, They haven't been challenged legally for doing that so ever since they have be doing what ever they want quite literally. 

We have given them permission to write their own rules even though the law doesn't work like that and we wonder why they are trying to take us for everything, unironically gamming has been the business equivalent of just printing money on demand because we allowed them to do it this is why they are convinced they can up serve formulaic slop while making line go up ALSO while bagging commission and bonuses at the managerial and directorship levels of these companies. No being funny but this is an historically identifiable pattern of corrupted behaviour.

We need to know we actually own our games, I signed up for steam  back when the agreement was a purchase meant you owned and distribution licences copy for personal use only no Re-distribution. They have changed the contract to a purely subscription service and have repeatedly threatened users with restricting account access until they comply, making people sign contacts under duress is illegal by English common law and always has been. This makes these contracts non legally binding and yes these companies know this, would be nice if content creators actually pursued issues like this properly by raising awareness around this stuff and calling for action.

Seriously why do we have consumer rights laws if we are not going to enforce them in the first place, this is just going to keep happening where they grind us down so that we accept not owning games anymore even though what they are is literally illegal, Oh but good guy Gabe and Valve blah blah blah yeah yeah yeah I love their current ""subscriber agreement"" for the games I bought not rented.............. 

when will people wake up? this could have been taken care of years ago, now just look at where we are it's pathetic.",0
2115,If it was intended that a PSN was a must before launch + sony is a publisher that sells it...

I remember I got auction scammed in Classic WoW for like 4000 gold (basically all gold I accumulated through classic before TBC) by purchasing a ""wrong"" item on auction. My TSM didn't have confirmation window check so when I was buying mats for the libram of whatever (head/leg enchant), AH didn't have enough items on it so it sniped all available with some of the materials being sold for 800g instead of 5g.
I was very butthurt about it for a hour or so, but since its in-game money and because it was a joke to my friends, it also became humorous to me. (Admit it's funny, buying enchanting mats for 1000% price).
So being an artist I drew a picture about it and posted it on classic reddit. You'd be surprised how many people assumed I was a scammer, or gold seller, or had some very shady reason to do it. When I literally lost all my gold in game and drew a picture about it to solidify this event as a joke by sharing the joke with classic community.

That excuse is just BS overall. Should've delayed the launch (including the sales to these countries) and avoided all this crap.

Either way Arrowhead isnt fully innocent either to my opinion for making such a shitty deal with SIE. Both Arrowhead & SIE got what they deserved.

2422,"Id disagree with the comment about “being a devil’s advocate”..

Just because you don’t believe something but pose a logical question or insight into something doesn’t mean it’s not worthy of consideration. It’s the degree in which the argument or question is asked and specifically what it is in regard to that would deem wether it’s worth covering or not. A question is a question not a belief. So as long as the question isn’t outright “stupid” I don’t see how being a devils advocate is necessarily bad provided the right question is asked. 

Kind of childish to suggest banning people for posing questions or arguments. Just ignore them OR phrase yourself better so you get more precise arguments to the topic you are looking for.

2475,"See the problem I have with the logic behind PSN account holders having a higher conversion rate so make everybody PSN account holders, that kind of data is inherently going to be heavily skewed. A large part of PSN account holders is that they took the time and effort to make a PSN account regardless of being forced to do so. They are the hard dedicated core of PSN players that were going to eat their shit with a smile anyway. Now you're funneling a whole bunch of people that don't necessarily care to make that account, and largely because of that weren't likely to be big spenders either, and now you're going to add them to the statistic of your PSN account holders. I think this forced merger of the two groups misses the mark on why the statistics say what they do. Their real question shouldn't have been how can we force those two groups together. It should've been how can we convert more people from the bad group and motivate them into the good group. Because now they're motivated and going in there on their own free will, they are in fact part of that more dedicated core of users which will be actually likely to spend and spend more. I predict their PSN account holder numbers are going to dillute if anything now because not only did they now force a whole bunch of non-dedicated users without actually changing their consumer behavior to your dedicated consumer pool, you also gave them a reason to resent you for being there which if anything is going to drop the few that did have a spending habit in the other pool.",0

2534,"It's absolutely a scam; reeling in players, then locking them out of the game without immediately providing refunds for everyone who refuses to make the account.

If this company had integrity, this wouldn't be happening, and at *minimum* players would be getting refunded without question. 'Hey, we're under contractual obligation and Sony forced us to do this' or similar, it's not that complicated -- most people wouldn't refund anyways. But that's just not happening.. Instead we get cryptic messages from a CEO.

""At least he's honest."" A guilty verdict is a guilty verdict, I don't understand where we lost the sauce and decided honesty equates to integrity or innocence, or lessens the impact at all. Maybe they should have been honest day 1 and required PSN on install. 

This whole stream came off as Asmongold being an apologist for manipulative people; the epitome of devil's advocate. It's scary to wonder many people look up to influencers with a moral core disheveled to this degree. Today, it's playfully defending a funny game scam to farm viewership, tomorrow those same business or self-gratifying motivations might lead him to do something with real damage. Who knows, I just really hate this person, I'll be honest. Hate him more than most.",0

Hopefully this is the beginning of a ""nah we're not doing this anymore"" to excess account bloat etc...
There was a lot in my opinion that was bad about this. I wish Arrowhead would have made an official statement sooner. I wish their community managers would have handled it better. They clearly were not trained or managed for situations like this. Either way Kudos lads. Never doubt your power together.",0
2540,"Seems that Sony underestimated their consumers. Good. I only feel bad for the devs that just wanted to create a fun game, and for it's players to enjoy their time.

There is no point of quitting out right other than ""I'll not come, that will show them"" which feels kinda stupid. Why not enjoy your money spent as long as you can and let the player count drop whenever the requirement becomes mandatory?

That'll cover them if tomorrow they consider they're going to release games where this isn't the case in the future. However, they already know this will not be true for some of the games so it doesn't matter that they say we may change it in the future if you already know it's changed right now effective some point in the near future. That's the very same level of dishonesty. They're fundamentally pulling the rug from under people, revoking their ownership, trying to get them to sign into their souleating cult under duress, on products already sold. Goes to show the importance of DRM free games. You really don't own a product these days and there's two recent examples Crew and now Helldivers 2, that you cannot trust companies to abide by their side of the gentlemans agreement when it comes to ensuring you can keep using the product anyway.",0
2596,"Boys, we won, now...how do we fight Stellar Blade's censorship issue?",0
2597,"I'm guessing a combination of two things.  First, the massive amounts of refund requests strained their relationship with Valve.  Second, their legal department informed them that they would likely lose a lot of lawsuits and face further reputational damage for bait-and-switch and breach of fiduciary duty, particularly in countries where you could buy the game on Steam but not set up a PSN account.  My guess is that Sony thought that pumping up their PSN subscriber numbers and the user data's value was worth the cost, but they underestimated just how big of a financial and legal screwup this was.",192

I understand being upset about being price locked out of the game in certain countries, but let's be honest. Most of the people bitching are just upset over an slight inconvenience and see these other problems they aren't even experiencing as an excuse to blow it out if proportion. I guarantee that if the only issue was that a few countries had to buy a ps to make an account most of you wouldn't even care. It's not about what's right or wrong for me, I'm just dumbfounded by all this hypocrisy. The player numbers barely moving tells you everything you need to know.

Personally i like playing a game where i can log in, play it at my leasuire and log off. Games like wow and similar were amazing early on and were super easy and as a by product were super fub to play. Sadly now its gear centric and engagement centric. 😢",0

2857,"We shouldn't compare Arcade games too much to proper computer and console games even though consoles had many Arcade ports. Many of these ports had the problem, that the Arcade design of coin guzzlers was kept inside, even though you couldn't put more coins in the console and had to made due with the few credits / continues they gave you. Even back then I wasn't really a fan of Arcade ports and would rather play the better looking originals, at a time when Arcade graphics were years ahead of what you could get at home.

Btw, do people really have more games now? I'm speaking of children that do not earn their own money. It's not like our parents couldn't afford the amount of games as we as adults can now. Comparing our adult selfes to back when we were kids is the wrong way to do it. It should be kids nowadays vs kids back then. Not counting F2P as they are a different can of worms...

The ""meta game"" is a good point though and one of the reasons why (online) gaming will never feel the same again. It doesn't even matter that Blizzard brought out WoW Classic as most people simply used guides and BiS lists. Like Paladin players taking away the few spell damage cloth items from casters because of ""It's BiS for me!!!111""...
That raids in WoW were made harder over time was most likely thanks to addons cheesing encounters and guides already being released before said raids have even been released on live servers.
To this day I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't need to install addons and read encounter guides before raiding as people should figure out mechanics while actually raiding. Everything else is like playing games with a walkthrough...

Min-maxing is fine if you do it by using your brain instead of using guides. I had multiple raid characters in Vanilla and was min-maxing by looking a loot lists and what of the loot in dungeons and raids would make sense. Let's just say that my twink mage was outclassing nearly all the mains constantly. I was even asked by one of the main mages how the hell I did it; focus on +hit and spell power when lots of casters went for high int and crit. Still remember the raid leader, a mage player, proudly proclaiming that he reached 10k mana...

I still like the classic design better as it felt more open and less theme parky. Multiple starting and leveling zones of the same level range really helped too. It was nice that WotLK gave you the choice between fjord and tundra, with slightly different paths you could take after these zones.
Also when I started WoW in 2004/05 (US and EU betas followed by retail), the overarcing story had no importance. Hell, I would even say that there was no overarcing story to begin with and it still didn't stop people from signing up.

PS: In 2006 we had guild websites with forums and Teamspeak 2. Before, when playing UO, nearly everybody had ICQ. No need for Discord.",0
2858,not really the same point but. ive done like 10 playthroughs of factorio (616h). in the beginning i spent 12 hours on one of the tutorial maps because i had so much fun to figure out what to do. but the more i played the more i knew and i just built efficient factories and just use the same principles every time it lost steam for me. some players just have the perseverance to make bigger and bigger factories but now when i play i just want to fire the rocket and be done. i cant play it solo anymore. to me some games just stops being fun when you know too much about how it all works. that said a new update late this year is coming and its supposedly going to be as big as the original game itself and that i am excited for because there will be stuff i dont know about again.,0

2861,"One thing to add to it is. I and my friends did exactly this when we started playing WoW when Azeroth came out. We walked around explored nooks and crannies and took things very slowly and enjoyed it. I think is not a true ideal of when WoW is just a game. When you play for nearly 20 years or more you get passed the point of exploring and taking things slow. The only thing left for you when you play a game long enough is to always chase that end game. Regardless of World of Warcraft it can be any game, If you want to play WoW the exact way you did in 2006, you still can, but you dont, and thats a choice you made.",0

2874,I agree about people skipping stories and then complaining. Alot of the problems is with players themselves. I don't like everyone's rushing through game these days mentality. I've seen many people do that and then complain a game is too short or doesn't have much when they obviously missed all of the side content and extras. I like when games are fun and don't take themselves too seriously too. A part of the problems is progress or items in games these days is buying something with real money instead of allowing you to play and unlock or find them.,0

2885,"you all complain about ""social systems"" in mmos not existing. they never did exist. there is no such thing as a ""social system"". you cant force people to be social. the reason the game used to be social is because when you were a kid you just wanted to log on and RP in elwynn forest with ur friends. end game pvp for you was dueling your friends in durotar, not grinding the arena/rbg ladder. the game was more of a discord server than an actual game. (this is why GTA RP is still popping off on a more than 10 year old game)

now we all just want to speed run to max level, speed run gear, and spam mythic plus/raids/pvp in lfg and then never speak to any of those people again. they are basically just npcs to us.

the reason mmos arent social anymore is because you dont want to be social. you want to play the game. nothing wrong with that at all. just the way it is.",0

2891,"The problem with the big ""save the world"" story arcs is that almost all of the quests you do are in support of discovering what big bad is happening, but you can just skip the whole story (including in dragonflight) to just learn it all in a single raid or a handful or quests before the raid, because the developers now that most people skip them. Its a key component that turns the game into ""hurry and wait"" for endgame. 

I never played OSRS (just runescape then) until recently, and I am enjoying it a lot now just exploring haunted mansions, salting hides for deranged museum curators, etcs. I like that the objectives are small and relatable. Saving the world is fun sometimes. How many gods do you have to kill before it feels like your shopping for cereal? I would say about two.",0

I logged in a couple months ago and there were two people on my server, and no indication of where I should or could go to find population to play with, but they would eagerly take my money to server hop in the pursuit of one.

2915,"retail is dead forever. the true WoW killer is WoW Classic itself. Retail is irreversibly f-cked and it will never be like classic. Classic is a much easier, simpler and liberal game while retail has become extremely complex and limiting. Retail combat is about pressing at least one ability every single second as well as using offensive and defensive cooldowns,, while Classic combat sometimes almost feels like playing hearthstone which especially for melee classes mostly revolves around auto attacks and abilities using next-swing mechanic, which offers a much simpler and relaxed combat experience unlike retail in which you have to spam spells by smashing your keyboard like a gen-z iPad kid. For the old wow player base, wow will be revolving around classic mostly imo. And I believe that retail will be dead soon enough that it won't be able to see all of the trilogy of expansions they have announced. That's why they announced a trilogy expansion, forcing players to believe retail won't be dead at least for the next 3 expansions but I doubt that. Blizzard will also eventually have to release permanent tbc classic and wotlk classic servers, and the classic will remain forever as a cult game and follow a seasonal pattern like SoD.",0

Your bag is stuffed with shit nobody needs or knows whats the things are used for,crafting is a total mess with several levels of the same Material,also cluttering bags and stash, PVP is a meme (because there is no more War going on lorewise),new systems and currencies with every Season (not even expansion...no..Season!),Story locked behind Rep.grind, every world event from all Season are active in the world (you get synapses overload as returning player), PVE is wacky because of 3rd Party tools,to confusing and punishing mechanics and several different difficulties (again), all the things youve done in the Past and all the loot you got...even killing old gods,saving the world bla bla bla...worthless because you get better items from slappping 5 Squirrels in a damn World-Quest.

During/After WoTLK they made it just dumb and boring to accommodate as many people as they could and they lost their sense and direction…..for me. It just seemed lazy and still does.

2927,"I don't agree with Asmongoldf here. Minmaxing can be forced by the game. For example, let's take a very extreme example: chess. What are chances that a player will decide to walk around and explore the board, ignoring another player?
1) You can start to do it, but another player most likely will just destroy you for doing this.
2) There's not much to look at, if you'll start moving around the board aimlessly.
This is the case of game design forcing players to do what's intended, while any other behavior doesn't make sense.",0

I miss when game developers had fun making their games, making experiences that they expected their players would love to play, not held back by unfair paywalls. Paid DLC was the beginning of this whole mess, but it was reasonable. 

Now, they want you to pay for expiring battle passes, which is just their way of milking the customer on a game they'll replace with an even more expensive lackluster version the next year.

A lot of indie developers tend to make those great games that are genuinely fun nowadays. AAA studios with malicious publishers are doing everything they can to ruin it for the end-user and milk them dry.",1

2943,"Asmon is completely right. The same people who were playing MMOs twenty years ago as kids are now in their late 20s and 30s. It is not necessarily that the game changed, its the people playing it.  If I was 30 when Runescape and Wow were in their early days, Of course I would've been significantly better and played in a much more efficient manner than kids in the 5th grade. And now that everyone is about min maxing and efficiency, any other style of gameplay gets you left out of Guilds, clans, groups, ect.",0

2945,"I know exactly what you mean by things we decide for ourselves that we need to do. Last year, around this time, I started Playing Phantasy Star Online 2. I was enjoying it for a little while, but then I got to end game and had nothing to do. So I started doing the dailies every morning. After a year of doing the daily grind and logging out, I've come to the conclusion, I have to stop. It isn't fun, and it puts me in a bad mood for the day, from dealing with the same repetitive things, finding little things that annoy me about it, etc. So I decided I'm done with it. Especially since my material storage is expiring soon, and I'm tired of buying storage space in general.",1
2946,"It's still not sinking in for some people. The issue isn't about nostalgia, min-maxing, storytelling, or any of that. The true allure of MMOs, the reason they soared to popularity, was the freedom they offered. It was about the freedom to be whoever you wanted in this virtual realm. Whether you wanted to optimize your character, indulge in crafting, take down mythical beasts with your online pals, farm for resources, or simply explore the city rooftops with your low-level buddy - the choice was yours.

But nowadays, games impose rigid systems, predefined paths, mandatory progression, reputation grinds, time gates, and whatnot. We're paying for the game, so why not let us pursue what brings us joy? I'm not a fan of daily quests, weekly tasks, or mandatory reputation grinds. Sure, I might engage in them willingly, but the moment they're forced upon me, they cease to be enjoyable and instead become a chore - especially when falling behind the curve is the consequence.

If I want to optimize my gameplay, I'll do so, but don't force me into a binary choice of min-maxing or not playing at all. Remember the days when farming resources was a satisfying endeavor? Nowadays, who even bothers when you can just purchase in-game currency? Let me carve out my own path. Provide me with the tools and options, but don't dictate what I must do, where I must go, or whom I must accompany. I want to be the architect of my own adventure, not subject to the whims of game designers.

Ultima Online, Everquest, WoW Vanilla - they were phenomenal games because they were teeming with lore, intricate mechanics, diverse activities, and a vibrant player base. But what set them apart was their lack of heavy-handed game designer intervention. In those worlds, you charted your course, and that's what made them truly exceptional.",0

2952,"When I played WoW it took me 30 days (/played) to get to Lvl 60 because I did so much PvP at Lvl 40+. I did Min/Max when I got into raiding because I like the math stuff and it was rewarding. Now you level as fast as possible and meta setups are a requirement. So there is no reward for doing it, but a punishment if you do not.

Maybe reducing the raid size from 40 to 20 or dynamic scaling was a mistake. If you can beat a boss with either 20 good people or 40 bad, it would be more inclusive. Actually, if you have a fixed amount of loot per boss you would still get more rewards per person if you can do it with less people. But it would be doable for bad players.
And if you can't play together with someone, because he/she is too bad and taking them with you would hurt your chances more than it would help, that is not much fun.",0

I missed the part where I could enjoy the game due to wanting to catch up with everyone else. It does take away the fun and makes it feel more like I have no time to have fun, I gotta grind!

2966,"I recently got back into WoW, and the main thing i noticed is that nothing you do feels like it matters. Like before even while leveling you had these personal goals of yours like getting a mount or even completing the that class quest for warrior, you will always remember that. What does the same thing in retail wow, nothing everything is fleeting and forgettable, there are just not many experiences in the game. Even after playing classic after years i felt the same stuff, the world felt more relatable just by making the leveling slower you were stuck in a zone for a longer time you started apreciating living in that world. Now you're zooming through the place achieving absolutely nothing. When you get an item piece you don't even care. Before when you get something good while lvling you would know, even raiding. Now the world of warcraft just doesn't feel like a world anymore. It's a themepark for quick dopamine fixes, with no real goals in sight.",0
2967,"When i lost my way to Burning Stepps from Lakeshire, I died to goblins attacks ( of course) but that just made me to get in that zone more but those minions were gurding the entrace and for my low lvl 20 I couldnt see their level, for me they were a boss. So I had to leave that place for some other time when Im gona be stronger and from time to time that I gained some levels and gear I went back to check If I was mighty enought to slay them or atleast survive enought to get past them into the deadly high level Burning Steps zone. I manage to do that around lvl 40 and it was amazing, I found a flight path and was so proud that once I hit the required levl of 50 I will be able to just fly there like a pro. .... good old times",0

2974,"9:37 I thought this was fucking stupid. There is no god damn way any characters on all of azeroth should have even been able to get remotely close to stopping Sargaras. He was supposed to be one of the big bads of the entire story, kinda like a cosmic entity, its not supposed to be defeated. Only postponed, or out maneuvered and prevented from gaining access to the world. But the champions have such strong plot armor that they've completely trivialized all the story elements of the game. 
 
While the cut-scene of him stabbing Azeroth was cool, the whole reason and build up to why it was happening was dumb as shit.
 
This was the point in the history of the game where I lost all ability to suspend disbelief any longer.
 
The scale doesn't always need to be big. And if you always have to one up your previous conflict, then that is fundamentally bad writing. There are no exceptions to that rule, however even stories with not the greatest or most well written stories are bad stories altogether. I really like some Shonen Jump, but it can't be every story. Hell I remember watching a Bruce Lee movie where he broke his back after a fight, and the conflict wasn't about beating the even tougher dude, it was about overcoming his own personal adversity and the unfairness of the world.

2981,"other thing that has been killing wow for some time now, i know many will not accept and say that its the way it is, but wowhead kills every content patch or new expansion with the datamining, yeah there are people that dont read story, like me, but like to see the art, read the class changes, and all that stuff instead of being experienced when the game comes out, you almost know everything about the game, also making min maxing guides for the actual game endgame kills things like treassure hunting, i mean, if you are experiencing treassure hunter game having a ""guide"" or an addOn is absolutely cheating, most of treassures are spot hidden via coordinate datamining and found that way instead of how they should do, there is some stuff that might not have guides, guides can work for teaching you rotations and that stuff but not to reveal stuff thats meant to be secret, the datamining ruins the experiences of seeing a boss for the first time in game, and most people read datamined content because is ""usefull"" to min max at some point... maybe there is an in between, maybe blizz can get people who make guides to do not publish them right away and give it like 2-3 months when there are no guides, and after that they release them for people that couldnt do it without...",0

Unlike some of previous expansions, I couldn't push keys nor raid cuz I had 5 hour of dailies to do and if I didn't my performance would be crippled, which is shit and had nothing to do with skill nor time put in content i actually liked.

They are NOT using anything outside the game in addition to ""just playing the game"". The vast majority does not want to ""beat the game at all cost"" and take every possible step to do so. 

Since the internet is a wide thing, ""nerding"" games has become more public. But it doesn't mean it became more popular. The majority only plays the game. 

Even Blizz has said that once: their own WoW-Forum is only used by 5-10 % of their playerbase, even though every single subscriber has automatic access to that forum. 

There is always more to it than people think. Just like thosr delusional people that thought that in 2008 when there have been 12 mil active accounts, they thought that those were only people that came since the beginning.

Modern WoW (anything past Wrath) is a linear progression storyline that guides you through the leveling. 

That's the issue. It's no longer ""Go, figure it out, and have fun!"". Instead it's, follow the path to win.

Back when I played much older games, for example the release of WoW or the oringinal Souls Games, heck even the first few final fantasy games. I would just go off and explore, whatever I found was just what I saw as available and I didn't have to look for the quickest way to get X. If I did want a guide then I would be waiting to see if there was something in the latest edition of a magazine, or seeing if one of my friends had discovered anything.

We say and think we want one game like that but we don't, people don't just...exploring the gameworld now anymore and games that prioritize that will be deemed ""boring"".

Let's face it, what will be the first thing you do when you start a new MMO? Look for meta builds, let's be truthfully honest and I am sorry but that's the case for most of us, you don't Google or Youtube ""best place to chill in MMO A"" or ""which is the most beautiful spot in MMO A"", you Google or Youtube how to build your character and what if a game somehow has ALL THE BUILD EQUALLY STRONG, like, statistically no difference, there is no ""meta"", what would you do? Would you enjoy the game as it is? No! You will think that this is a trash game, no matter how beautiful it is, no matter how many spots that have extreme attention to details, if you can't ""compete"" or ""finish the game faster"" or ""grind something"" or, in some cases ""pump money in for progress"" then it is a trash game to most of us

I am sad myself that the gaming industry has done this to me, to us, but unfortunately that's the case now which is why MMOs can't just....Try to build something for the experience, it is just not profitable anymore and even if it might work some of the time, odds are it will fail is just too high, and such risks cannot be accepted by corporations when accepting a project to be initiated

If you still think that I am wrong, think about this, how many of you know the lore behind Dark Souls? See? We no longer care about the experience because the industry has SHAPED us to focus on progress, on get used to the game fast and end it even faster, and no offense to Dark Souls, I spend...maybe a few hundred hours on it, completing NG+ as well when DS 1 first came out, but I did NOT care about why we have to rang 2 bells, I just need to know how to fight those Gargoyles, and me 15+ years ago was someone who would drive from Los Santos to Las Venturas after finishing the game just to see how far it is and just to enjoy the radio in GTA SA, I've changed because of the gaming industry just like most of us here, and that is sad if you think about it",0

3094,"So as a game designer and a writer, I want to point out that what's being said from about 6-7 minutes in is... basically a layperson's limited understanding of what's going on. Asmongold sorta gets it, but not quite fully.

The thing is, you want EVERY aspect of every game, every novel, every TV show or whatever, to add to the experience. Do not build stuff that is useless, you're wasting people's time. But... an empty hallway CAN add to that sometimes, if that's the type of feeling you're going for. If you're building something that's supposed to give off vibes of like symphony of the night's castle being ""a creature of chaos"" that changes shape constantly and is trying to screw with you, then dead ends make total sense and should exist, sometimes without a reward at the end. The good game design there is to sometimes have good rewards for exploring as well, however.

This is especially apparent in things like short stories because you have such a tiny, limited amount of word count to cover stuff that needs to be covered. You'll note short stories aren't just bam bam bam action sequences start to finish, though. There's still rises and troughs in the pacing, there's still moments of describing the area in detail a lot of the time, some genres more than others. The point is that you're always adding something of value at all times, but what's being added of value is not necessarily gameplay in a game, oddly enough. The game IS a game, you NEED to include good gameplay... but you can also just have stuff that exists for other types of fun besides the combat system. Exploration is a type of fun many people enjoy, so a big open world should have stuff to find, and it doesn't always have to be tied to a reward like a treasure chest. It can just be tied to ""oh wow, I found this absolutely gorgeous waterfall with magical floating crystals and it looks amazing in the sunrise and the designers actually put effort into making the floating crystals each play a different note when the sun hits them first thing in the morning as the light line travels across the ground in-game."" that's actually part of game design, and it's intentional. It's part of what makes a truly epic, top-tier game be separated from a ""fairly good game"" is that fine attention to detail and to always be providing something of value to the player at all times, but to also understand you have a variety of different player types and to cater to each one with a variety of things they find appealing.

Combat is good if it's a combat-focused game, but combat's not the only thing to do in an MMORPG. If 100% of your focus on the game design is just combat, your MMORPG will not last, because you need to appeal to not just the player, but their family, their friends, everyone they know. That's why WoW vanilla did so well, was there was something for literally everyone. The playerbase who has been cultivated over the expansions though, have been hand-held and guided only to combat and do daily quests non-stop, so that's who plays it, and when WoW classic came out... grandma didn't join in this time. If she tried, she would find it was a hostile place because the game had been pushing against that concept of just having a relaxing time exploring and gathering herbs for an hour and logging off. The social aspects were stolen by other things like social media, discord, things like that. There's no need for WoW any longer to appeal to these people, and MMORPGs are probably dead as a concept because of it.

You could MAKE a new MMORPG that's good... but you're not just competing against other MMORPGs any longer. You're competing against twitter/x, against discord, against deep rock galactic of all things. This is going to lead to a very different set of things than what existed before no matter what. A lot of the design is counterintuitive as well, where what the players ""really"" want is not what they think they want. Quicker, easier times getting into dungeons is what they think they want, but it turns out they're just playing with effectively NPCs who run the dungeon on autopilot and never talk to each other. They didn't spend half an hour forming the group and trying to fight their way down into the dungeon only to wipe twice on the way there and were determined to finish as a group because they felt they owed it to each other. MMOs in general are social by nature, but they've largely removed the social aspect from them. You need other people to do stuff, but you don't WANT the other people because the other people are just a liability to you. They aren't fun to play with, they aren't fun to talk to, they're just a silent machine that kills stuff for you or gives you healing. If you replaced them with bots, you'd literally not even be able to tell the difference. The other people are present, but they aren't interacting with you in a meaningful way socially.

Anyway, the point is that game design is complicated as fuuuuu and what the players think they want is not what they actually want most of the time, and a great designer can provide benefits to you that you didn't realize you wanted in very subtle, careful ways. It's still game design as a game, but there's more to a game than just the combat system or quests, which the current devs don't seem to actually understand because they inherited it without understanding it.",0

Video Creator: ""There was a day when games werent designed to <do this and that>""
Asmon: ""Thats not true, because I have a single example thats a exception! While the bulk of games used to prove the rule."".

That thinking is dumb. Asmon does that a lot. He have no knowledge of the world before he was a teen, and makes up his own ideas about the time. I see that a lot with things from the 80's/90's with him. For him, gaming started with XBox and WoW. Other stuff almost did not exist before that as far as he is concerned, or simply was not relevant... because it was not relevant to HIM. Or in this case, he knows MK existed in the 90's, but ascribes a 00's/10's view of gaming to make the false insinuation that all games were like MK.

I'm a fan. But this is my biggest issue with him. I generally see it most with his dumb view on EverQuest. Because WoW was his first MMO, EQ was and is irrelevant. Something I find particularly funny when I see him describe what he loves about original WoW... when it actually reads more like a checklist of what was lost from the MMO transition from EQ to WoW. He's almost indirectly a huge fan of EQ, while also being its biggest hater... while having never played it.",0

3164,"It's hard to get out of the min/max mindset when it feels so beneficial, or is sometimes even required, in these games. I noticed this happening to me about 24 years ago in Everquest. I became so obsessed over levels/DPS/gear/efficiency/ect that I started to lose sight of the game, lose interest in the game, lose interest in just having a good time with the friends I made in there. When I first started to realize it I tried to slow things down, go back to exploring and enjoying all the little things.

After a bit I tried looking for gear that had goofy effects or effects that changed how I would normally play my character. Usually you had to camp mobs for hours or even days to get some items. Thanks to that inconvenience I thoroughly explored that zone, found lots of hidden tidbits, and even became good friends with someone else who was camping that mob. Unfortunately I got pulled back into min/maxing pretty quickly because it's just too important in so many of these games.

3165,"classic feels like it was designed as a world before it was designed as a game. this makes it feel alive despite being kinda barren in a few places. 
even then, the actual game play was designed around the journey to get from level 1 to level cap, endgame was not as emphasized as heavily. this also helps the world feel alive.
as far as your interactions with NPCs and the world go, you were always subjected to what i call “the Forrest Gump” experience. in the grand scheme of things, the world and its history is fairly indifferent to your existence. however, you are a minor participant that is present for all major events in the story but it never had to be you specifically. with or without your direct involvement, history would have carried on just fine. but your personal experience with each event is what makes them special. questing with the boys in a given zone, pugging raids, or wiping on dungeon trash for some silly reason. that shit made it special. 
somewhere along the way they forgot about moment to moment forrest gump gameplay and went all in on endgame content which was the most boneheaded shit they could have possibly done. SoD kind of takes it back to this experience by making use of previously overlooked or neglected zones, but i don’t know if i’d say that we’re so fucking back or anything.

When every plot point has higher stakes than the previous the game loses the ability to tell more simple/subtle stories because they will feel inferior/irrelevant due to all the crazy stuff that happened before. The guy in the video made a great point about the universe ending Jailor. How do you follow that up with a story that feels meaningful? You don’t. That’s why Dragonflight felt flat. Not because the way the story was told. It’s because in comparison, there is no stakes in dragon flight. Even if the player fails, it will have little impact on the story - which is the correct way to story tell/ world build. You aren’t meant to be the champion of Azeroth. The player is not a Messiah. But blizzard has made it so and as I explained above, once you have become the messiah there is no going back. Paul Attreides taught us that. Rare L take from Asmon.",0

I've been thinking all day long, the last thing I wanna do is think even more. My energy is in the negatives.

People think too much. They have too many choices and can be critical. That's great, but it also means you focus too much on the bad stuff and don't enjoy games as simple entertainment. I see games that I enjoy with mostly negative reviews where like 90 % of them is about the end game or some meta gameplay not being on par with other similar games.

Now you can play a black weird elf LGBT like with a shaolin china gameplay wtf bro ?

Just from the character creation Retail WoW is trash now. How can you expect to get a good game if you don't have a solid baseline from the races and classes ?

Blizzard should stop to normalize everything. Why you want every classes 3 specs ? Why you want exactly the same amount of races per faction ? 


On Retail WoW they made new races but they are just skins, there is no start zone 1-15 for them.
I want to be a Fel Red Orc from Outland but i can't, and even if i can i will just be a skin color from basic Orc.

Another example, Worgen. There skin are garbage, furry like instead of the old Vanilla one. Also why the fuck Worgen can be Priest Holy or Hunters with a dog etc. ?! Worgen should be a unique classe/race like Demon Hunter but with ONLY one and good spec designed. A Worgen with jump, bleeding spell damage like Feral but more savage.


The shaolin Monk, should be also a unic classe/race available only for the Pandaren. To make them unique and special.

For every classes every races there is something to BIG CHANGE.

But Blizzard is lazy, they have LGBT emotional in their team instead of getting pro medieval lover and pro heavy metal lover in their team.

3202,"From my understanding, the original video creator played Old WoW to level 20, dropped it, picked WoW back up again a year ago as fuel to the fire that is his YouTube yapping livelihood. With that context available, it makes much more sense to me why he made this video where he talks alot, but says very little. He doesn't talk about WoW like someone who actually plays it often, he doesn't offer any proposals for actual changes to the game that would make it better, he doesn't specifically identify what he thinks makes the game worse. It's all vague concepts, and yapping.

As someone who started playing WoW in the same year he did, but continued to play the game through Mists of Pandaria, the major problem (as he describes it) is obvious. Making new environments and artistic assets that make him go ""oooh"" and ""ahhh"" is significantly more expensive than making things that live within menus. 

Glyphs, a new gathering profession, reworked talent trees, new stat bonuses for gear. All that stuff is less expensive to make than new 3D models, new drawn textures to slap on them, new animations to move them, new environments to put them in. 

It's a business trying to do more with less. None of this being talked about in the original video makes the video creator seem ignorant to how game design works, as well. He doesn't talk about what the employees at Blizzard are doing, what their bosses are doing, what decisions they're making. This guy just wanted to yap about his melodramatic bullshit.

because it only a certain demographic; and the industries and corporation, nerf and buff, based on min maxing; ruining the experience for everybody else who just wants to enjoy a game.

This is why I hate wow retail; because wow level scaling is so annoying not only I don't know how the story should even progress, but the level scaling makes crits damage, parry, dodge such a pain; because every single time you got to invest ridiculously on min maxing them so your build as certain classes would be viable even; due to every single level lowering crits, dodge and parry also block; making it a tedious pain.

it becomes worse on dungeon content; because there a bunch of low-level player who just smack into oblivion the whole dungeon, while a level 40 player has to spam a bunch of abilities to even get half the damage in, that a tank does, even if the level 40 player is a dps;

it's just so annoying and frustrating; it's basically just bad game design; let the min maxers be min maxers, don't ruin the game for the rest of the player base; just because a literal 1% of people is slaying more than what the devs intentioned.

It's so frustrating; especially when nerf comes to reduce the cheese spamming a specific build 24/7, and all it achieves is that now everybody who play the build does not min maxing, or the person who plays the class the build is based on, has to min max to even be able to play the game; due to nerfs, it's such bad game design.

Pve games, are separate from pvp; it also another problem, when devs nerf something on pvp, and it effect drastically pve ; like freaking decide what the game it is, pve or pvp, because both pve, and pvp is literally extremely two different game mode; there will never be a IDEAL leveling between the 2; its literally impossible; it's like trying to sell a luxurious tv at a dollar store; you just can't it 2 different types of products; and people come to the dollar store for a reason to buy something cheap/affordable, not something expensive;

3212,"Wow Classic was great up until raiding in WotLK.  The guild was chill in raids, if someone needed gear, we would push that gear to them.  Come LK, I needed gear, but they would push my upgrades to a healer for their DPS spec because ""They were doing double duty"".  The item was literally my only upgrade unless they decided to do 10Mans too.  I went with it for a few weeks then just decided I wasnt going to deal with them pushing my gear to off specs and alts (I wasnt doing bad either, stayed out of fire, did competitive DPS with the gear I had) and switched specs from aff to distro and vice versa depending on the fight (more movement, aff, can stand and pew pew, destro).

Back during Actual WotLK, Our guilds handed out gear as needed to keep it fair.  Game lost its fun factor for me, but I did sub up again to try the season of mastery because it seems interesting.",0

The issue isn't that WoW doesn't allow it. It is because you've played the game forever and It does not matter who you are. You're not going to be able to duplicate those initial feelings.  At least not for any extended time outside of a bit of nostalgia. 

All the WoW haters are just oblivious.  You don't hate World of Warcraft. You just hate that your brain cannot be stimulated by the game in the same way it used to.  And that happens with almost every video game, all of us play.

Even before that there was pinball, and claw machines, which never rewarded you for anything other than the skill the player had to play the game. The Arcade gotcha games were more a result of game design companies actively choosing to maximize money, which inherently led to increasing active engagement. This mentality eventually bled into console games, but it dramatically reduced revenue, and those that make games had to find another way to get what they were after, money.

Modern game design comes from repeated product testing on the marketplace with the ideal's of maximizing revenue for the game developer, and it ultimately led to the gaming market collapse. We are heading towards another gaming market collapse.",0

Sometimes it's great to feel like a pioneer, and discovering a new world alongside thousands of others is a unique experience. It also allows people with little gaming time to walk a beaten path.

The game industry and the player community had a completely different perspective of what to play a videogame was, it was about enjoying it, instead of Ending it. There is also the fact that ( and this is my opinion) I was very young when I played wow in 2006-08 and I could spend days just playing, however, nowadays I can't spend that much time playing, which makes you value your free time much more. In fact, when I try to play a videogame I get bored very easily and very quickly, I don't know if this is because my experience with wow when I was young was amazing and nothing can compare with it nowadays or that I don't like videogames anymore.

A real-world example would be someone who goes to a bar and throws darts verses someone who joins a dart league and practices at home in order to win. Both enjoy the game for different reasons, but to pretend we don't look up to the better players, in sports and video games, is simply just a lie. In WoW, normal and heroic versions exist for this reason. Complaining about not being able to do the heroic version because it's too hard and requires ""min/maxing"" means that that version of the game is not for you. BUT I think those people who cry about ""min/maxing"" is generally the people who care about the competition more than they are willing to admit, otherwise, they wouldn't be upset to not be competitive.",1

3389,"Morrowind. Except the devs ruined it with the damn obtuse leveling system, horrible combat, bad graphics, and cliff racers. So if I mod the game to excess, it might be enjoyable again, but the real issue is that I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. Same with Elden ring. IDC if people like the world or whatever and think that justifies bad game design. Let me tell you something, the only games I rate 10/10 are doom and quake, because they're balanced enough that I don't NEED to min max. Stop making games require min max meta builds, because that's CANCER. You can beat doom just using the shotgun. Every game should be balanced enough to not need meta builds, and let you enjoy it naturally. I'm not saying remove meta builds, they just should be OPTIONAL, and there should be no punishment for not doing it, and no fail states that require restarting the game. You can like badly designed games all you want, but there's clearly a problem when the games cause massive controversy over design and permanently cripple the player base. Who's going to start playing WOW or Morrowind in 2024? These insane design choices ruin the game. The fan boy defense of games like elden ring ruin the game. Here's an example: Descent. The series was originally designed for using a joystick, and the community refused to include mouse users. So the game DIED because joysticks died, and the community was toxic to mouse users. It's time to stop. Don't defend bad game design, keep the game relevant long term and not be about chasing meta. I honestly can NOT enjoy any of these games where I have to min max some build using a guide. I want to just play the game, the systems should be balanced, intuitive, and transparent. This isn't about difficulty. Doom Eternal is difficult AND balanced. Get rid of this meta requirement nonsense and let people play how they want. You're breaking immersion by forcing people to use builds and guides.",0
3390,"This is nonsense, people can play WoW however they want.  If you want to explore, go for it.  If you want to seek out random small chains, there are hundreds.  Not everyone wants to do high end raids or mythics.  People enjoy WoW to relax and the zones, music and ambience all allow this.  Nobody is forced into high end content.

I do not think how we are playing games right now is really playing anything it is more like following instructions and a chore with the fake victory of completing something. In the last couple of months I have stopped looking at guides, video's discussing games and so on and I tell you this I am happier for it I do not need some random content creator tell me how to play, games are not hard they are designed for us to win stop being spoodfed and start to play games without all the research I tell you there is much more fun to be had.",0

There is whole industry of competetive streaming, gaming and beating world firsts and PvP tournaments around which game is ''min-maxed''. When devs make games trying to min max their own revenue in short term they will inevitably try to cash out the extremes, instead of good gameplay. Story is sterile and self imposed, and best way to RP is to ignore any kind of story progression, which is directly tied to progression.

This is partly because the overall age of players has gone up, but also equally or more important that the variance of video games and video game mechanics is exponentially higher than it was several decades ago. The combination of increased variance plus decades of player experience depth leads to players refining their taste in video games. I wouldn't be able to tolerate most of the absolute trash games I would've ate up on the NES years ago. I don't play fighting, RTS, or racing games despite playing them extensively growing up.

I've been playing wow for 3 months now and i'm clearing heroic raids and even mythic bosses. Also 80% of my time playing wow its not doing ""meta"" things but exploring old content, doing random achievements and ambushing people trying to world quests in war mode.
As far as i'm concerned, current wow has more nooks and crannies that are there with no point besides exploration than entire decades worth of old games had combined. 
Also if people don't wanna play with you for whatever made up reason you have in your head, then just make your own raids and groups.",0
3402,"I definitely disagree with take about playing the game to play. Always, there was always goal in mind whenever I was playing a game till I started playing MMOs. Then goal was too far away but I was still chasing this unobtainable final state of my character or last quest. And to be honest this is what turned me off from WoW. After I finished everything in Legion or Classic, there was nothing else to do. No direction. I did some roleplay, met some people but I could go on for month maybe logging in to do nothing, just talk and walk around. I even got preps for all future raids that will be released but I never got there. Farming MC for 3-5 months wasn't the most pleasant experience, got old pretty fast. 

In past games had rarely continue, very limited amount of life and it was hard to get to point you failed at as it took you long time to get back and you could fail again. This made you play same game many many times as difficulty levels were high and we were too young to get good fast as our brains were still developing. Once I finished the game, even if I loved it, I didn't keep playing it. I got what I wanted, I achieved it. If I like the game, I will be back one time or many times to finish it again but it's not about keeping playing one game. It's about a goal, accomplishment, always been.

In MMO we also had goals. Not my fault that content is really polished now but releases are very slow compared to skill level required to complete tasks at hand. Since I am older, more experienced, it takes less time to complete another part of the game. Some people like games they finish so much that they keep playing or replaying them after that. For many years even (mostly autistic, nothing bad about it). 

Goals we had took longer because people used games as HUB to communicate, get to know and talk to each other. So we spent more time talking. Games were more like chatbox filled with game rather than game with ability to communicate. Did you play Path of Exile on HC when new season starts? Same feeling. People keep talking, shitposting, joking, helping each other or motivating. Even in middle of competition, some people just talk and joke around. If you remove communication, add queues for dungeons and raids, add no lasting consequences leaving/joining to guild or having reputation, this very important part is removed from the game. Similarly farming is a thing. Well, it was when bots didn't exist or get banned pretty fast. So real people had to play actual game and again, it might be boring and during boring part (grind), you talked to other people, chatted. This is always what MMOs used to be for me. This also was taken away. What's left? Pay, get gear, clear game, leave.

Without grind, reputation and need for communication, you have nothing but customized speed run. It's not really new players fault, they see game for what it has become. Imagine our community, people keep killing each other because nobody follows rules, no laws are established, there is no control. People are given food so lazy people don't need to work because are being fed, productivity goes down. Lack of structure has it's consequences. But hey, those are paying customers. Bots, goldsellers, included. Also little Timmy who finds game too complex, Zack who cries on forum about his Warrior dying to freezing mages, and adult Josh who has 7 wives and 20 children and doesn't have time to play but still wants to feel like he achieved same status as someone who puts everything to this game. So we make changes to keep EVERYONE happy and now, game is not what you originally started playing/purchased!",0

3411,"Item levels and the point at which developers stopped handcrafting items in MMO's is one of the main contributors to why MMO's feel so sanitized and homogenous.

There's little to no excitement for an item, because all that matters is ""your class can use it"" and ""what item level is it""

Sword A and Sword B can both have item level XYZ

Sword A will have 200str, 150dex, 125agi, and Sword B will have 195Str, 155Dex, and 125agi.

On a spreadsheet, sword A might do 0.0034% more DPS because it has 5 more str, but ultimately they're the same item.  The only thing that differentiates them is the visuals.

I also think removing proc effects from weapons in games like WoW was a massive mistake.  Procs allowed the developers to add flavor to items, and caused the player to have to actually THINK about whether an item was better or not.  Or maybe it was situational.  Anyways, i could rant about this forever, but i wont.",0

Games in arcades were obviously designed to make you spend more time engaging with it, to get your coins. That's what the video maker is trying to say about modern games. We've come full circle after having a nice twenty or so years in the sun playing home consoles and PC, after the decline of arcades. Games from the late nineties to the early 2010s were just games, you bought it, you played it and had access to all the content (until dlcs came around). Then micro transactions and dopamine drip mechanics came along.",1
3414,"Modern games are densely packed collections of important things to be collected, completed and minmaxed, and the games reward or even require you to do that. Useless details feel bad and disappointing because you are so hyper focused on the main task.

Good old games are a mix of important things and unimportant details in a way that you can't immediately see through. Since most things aren't important, you mostly interact with them for fun instead of a completionist obligation. Sometimes a thing you did yields better result than expected, sometimes worse, which contributes to the experience in a variable reinforcement way (modern games actually fail at this because of how lean and intentional everything is). While the game might be difficult, it's reasonable enough so that there's no need for minmaxing, nor there is any extra reward or medal for doing it. You just pick and choose your own way of reaching the minimum requirement to be able to progress, the way that you feel is fun and that works for you.

Modern game experience: ""Oh, this thing has better DPS"", ""oh this is part of that questline"", ""nice, 4 out of 6 completed"". ""oh, this is a good grinding spot""

Good old game experience: ""oh, what's that, I want to find out"", ""oh, this move is so fun/badass"", ""hmm I wonder which one is better - well I like this the most so let's go with that"", ""oh, where does this lead to?""

In short, game devs and players alike need to chill and just take in the moment-to-moment experience, more as a meditative experience, how the game feels and what you want to do in the game next. If a game is not fun like that, it's a bad game, though nowadays also consider that you might be mindbroken. There's nothing good at the end of the minmax road, there's no reward, it's all meaningless. The way games and platforms shove achievements in your face is not healthy. Go download original freeware Cave Story or something, nobody needs to know you are playing it, it's just you and the game and it's all up to you.",2

3436,"FFXIV does a good job of promoting the play for fun mentality. For one there's a lot more to the game than gearing up your character and raiding, most of the content in FFXIV doesn't make your character stronger and therefore isn't required. Even the most difficult content in the game only rewards cosmetics so there's no need to clear it asap.

Gearing up is very simple and you're hard capped on how much you can do every week, the amount of time needed to spend to reach this cap is pretty low. There's nothing like set bonuses or trinkets or legendaries to chase after. If you get unlucky with drops you still get currency to buy the same gear. Players are on a much more level playing field overall, there's a lot less competition to get in groups.

When it comes to the raids themselves mechanics matter a lot more than gear, practice runs where players have no intention of clearing and are only getting used to the mechanics are commonplace. There are fewer bosses, little to no trash, and the majority of raid content is easy. The most difficult raid content that rewards gear upgrades consists of 4 bosses every 8 months with no trash, and it's close to heroic raid difficulty in WoW but more punishing. That said if you don't enjoy the rest of what FFXIV has to offer it can get real boring.",8

3438,"Personally 100% agree on the DF story. It was relatively low-scale (okay, the premise was again apocalyptic from the start, Rasz wanting to return the world to its primal state and shit, but it wasn't universe-ending or whatever nor did she ever get close to her goals).

DF levelling zones were super relaxed, and even quite comfy at times. Smaller scale stories, exploring nooks and crannies that had little to nothing in them and not even necessarily being 'the champion' at times (i.e. visitor and explorer in Waking Shores, stranger in the Plains, guest/friend to the Tuskarr in the Azure Span and initiate-timewalker in Thaldraszus).

Only post-max level did you become 'the champion' where the flights needed your help, defeating a primal incarnate and all that. It was all super tame and relaxed. In the end I agree the story was pretty mediocre. I liked Raszageth but realistically she needed more than 1 patch. Killing her in the first raid was a mistake as she was relatively developed throughout the story and then killed off immediately (but then again I don't see how it could have gone otherwise if the Vault was going to be the first raid tier).

I've been playing through Cataclysm in retail, and while Classic Andies won't like hearing this, I think Cata nailed this kind of story. Yes, you're the champion, but only (assuming you start from level 1) after helping your own people, helping out others in this post-cataclysm world, and then eventually working your way up to helping Alexstrasza, fight Deathwings minions, help the Earthen Ring etc. Deathwing was the Raszageth of Cata, but he wasn't immediately killed off.",0

However, when I apply for pugs they tend to look for specific ""meta"" classes and oftentime blue or purple parses.

I thought he was weird and unreasonable at the time, but now I get it. I play Diablo 4 and WoW at a slow rate because I find the games fun.
I didn't grind to level 100 when D4 came out, I wanted to wait for the first season before attempting (and failing in the end as it was too grindy) and I recall everyone complaining about doing the renown again and about all the nerfs... that didn't affect me or my enjoyment.
And for WoW it is similar, I set some goals (mostly getting raid gear of a tier that I think looks cool, but never mythic), spend my time on those goals and then put the game to the side until the next patch/expansion.
Of course, both of these games can be better, and it seems they are going in the right direction... might be copium, but I have hope :)",2

3488,"Yesterday I was levelling my Mag'har Orc Arms Warrior in WoD zones that was max level in BfA that had starter endgame gear back then and was parked since SL release. That guy had pathetic squished to the ground gear that the gray items that dropped from weak outdoor mobs were 50+ item levels higher than my current equipped gear.

I always love when I have characters like this and then get the first green item that has a massive upgrade to my equipped gear and feel the power difference. I levelled him all the way to DF (which was 9 easy levels away) and didn't manage to replace all items so when I hit the dragon isles I started doing WQ for 350 ilvl gear that replaced my 85 ilvl gear with Azerite traits on them, and got that massive power difference satisfaction.

After I got up to speed, I just went to Valdrakken and put on a cool orcish transmog and a title and just RP walked around to areas with players and saluted fellow warrior and horde players and did some RP for like 2 hours and the fun I had doing that was more than what I had gearing my max level alts. Once I get the huge power difference from hitting gearing breakpoints in the game (new xpac, max level, new season, etc.) it doesn't feel fulfilling to me to upgrade 5 ilvls or 2% more power. Moving on to a different activity is more fun to me than grinding gear for a tiny upgrade so I can do a slightly or even significantly harder content that has a chance to make me 5% stronger than what I am currently am.

It is a matter of perspective of how you play the game, yes the game design sometimes forces you to do specific content and not do others, but that is not the case for DF, which was not the case for Shadowlands and BfA, even legion had that, but it was more enjoyable and fun. Most of the people who complain about the game and lead to what happened in BfA and SL is the ones who sit 16 hours a day grinding M+ and Arenas and then wont have anything to do.

3564,"The way I engaged with WoW and had the most fun was playing hybrid classes, and playing off-builds.  Modern WoW doesn't allow for this, and it hasn't allowed for this for a very long time.  I had a lot of fun building a holy paladin as an offensive caster, or a ret paladin as a primary healer; were these optimal?  Of course not, but that's where I had my fun.  It was fun because I was good at the game so even when using an suboptimal spec I was still better than the average player who was try harding, but lacked certain fundamentals that meant even if I had worse gear than someone, or a worse spec than someone I would still do better.

One of my core memories from WoW was back in the Vanilla days in AV, where you would have the PvEers decked out in their epics, but they were keyboard turners; so me in my blue quality PvP gear could kill them with ease.  Sure they beat the hardest bosses in the game, but at the same time I wiped the floor with them; it was hilarious.  This also mirrored itself in PVP as well, because the gear and the stats on them was more complicated back then.  There was a lot of 'junk' stats on gear, and a lot of gear was also stamina heavy; but if you knew the game, and knew the mechanics you could wear green quality gear that had purple level offensive stats and zero stamina and completely blow the average person out of the water when it came to DPS or HPS.

In short I agree with the video, but in a broader sense:  When a game has 'empty filler' people are given the option to engage with that filler material in unexpected ways.  WoW (and a lot of games honestly) are on rails now, a guided experience, and there's no 'dumb' choices people are allowed to make.  Back in the day Blizzard talked about ""meaningful"" choices or whatever as their excuse for getting rid of talent trees and standardizing all stats on gear, because ""everyone"" would play the cookie cutter stuff anyways.  Well no that wasn't the case because I was one of the people who didn't bother with cookie cutter stuff, but they got rid of all of the 'bad' choices and forced me to be cookie cutter with everyone else; and I quickly got bored, and then straight up aggravated by being pushed towards systems and content I simply did not like in the first place:  Raiding with cookie cutter gear and cookie cutter builds.  My mentality towards most games is ""Can I make this sub-optimal thing work?"" and when game designers decide their goal in life is to make it so that there's no such thing as sub-optimal, trying to balance everything perfectly as possible; then my gaming experience is completely flat, like a soda without the fizz.",1

3588,"In Dragonflight, the world designers tried to invoke that wide open feeling. That was a refreshing change from Shadowlands and BFA being tiny constrained amusement parks.

However, the game design was mostly the same which meant you were the major champion being ushered to and fro. Get that next quest, run here, 10 more checklist quests. Every single nook had a rarespawn or a quest. This conflicted with the wide open feel. And once you are rushed to max level it gets even worse as world quests bloat up the entire screen. Also towns being nonexistent or there just to facilitate the player's journey. It's just not a world.

And as far as RP is concerned, I think they missed a MAJOR win by designing the drac'thyr the way that they did. They could have had them be proper quadrupedal dragons with humanoid visage forms. Like every dragon in the game before DF. It's a non-issue to come up with some excuse for why they may be smaller than other dragons, or forced to be in their visage in combat. In addition, such a playable race could have had a cool lore background, such as being the new generation of Black dragons being led by Wrathion. Add to the race at a later date by putting in the option to create dragons in other dragonflights. Make the home areas of each dragonflight somewhere that players could come together in.

It is a fact that early video games on PS1, PS2 and earlier didn't have the same aim for a game. They provided a developers vision and creativity and had to make a good expression in all regards because buying the games was the only way for the developer to make money.

This incentive structure is completely fucked nowadays. Developers don't get rewarded for creative games. Developers get rewarded for making slot machines.

3712,"Here is a fun fact about Acheron lore if u have watched Acheron trailer, A Cleave Across the Transient World, there is a guy named""Kyoden"" , who comes from the word ""虚譚,"" which translates to ""deception."" If you watch until the end, you'll know what ""A Lie"" really means. 

""Once upon a time, Takamagahara was a beautiful land,"" said Yomi, one of the beings who ruled over the celestial realm, but Takamagahara used to be the land of beings called ""gods,"" a purebred race with power but also a love for peace. They owned ""the sun,"" the source of their energy. But one day, the sun was stolen. Its disappearance led to the emergence of the ""the dark sun? Blackhole?,"" which ravaged Takamagahara, devouring and destroying the divine beings, turning them into malevolent demons. 

— So who stole Suriyan(the sun) from Takamagahara? 

This is a reference drawn from the mythos of Shinto, the story of the ""Goddess Suria? Surya?,"" Amaterasu, who fled the heavenly realm and sought refuge in the caves of the human world. But if the sun of Takamagahara isn't a living being, it means that this sun was stolen by someone else, and likely not without the involvement of Izumo, the human realm. 

Izumo deceived its people, using ""Finallity"" as a pretext for starting a war to forge the sword of declaration, even though ""Finallity"" never actually existed. What Izumo and Takamagahara were actually encountering was the ""Blackhole (Shadow of Oblivion)"" all along, hovering above both worlds, gazing hungrily at their prey for ages. Yet, Izumo still pretended that it needed to eliminate an enemy, thus massacring the divine beings and creating the twelve swords of declaration. 

 The prolonged battle caused the wielders of the swords, the wielders of the power of the ""gods,"" to gradually transform into ""Oni (Demons)"" continuously. And when they had defeated the gods to the last, Izumo destroyed all twelve swords and forged the ""Origin Sword"" and the ""Finallity Sword."" At that time, the people of Izumo merged and became ""Remnants of the Wasteland (the black liquid  thingy that Acheron fights)."" 

  In the end, when ""Origin"" defeated ""Finallity,"" it consumed Finallity  and transformed into the ""sword of humans"" before using it to strike at the ""black hole."" 

— So what really happened in Izumo? 

The plan of Izumo or the higher-ups was to merge the human race of Izumo together, starting with the theft of ""The sun"" from Takamagahara to use its power in forging the ""swords,"" a total of 70,033 swords into the twelve ""Oni."" And when the twelve warriors defeated the gods until there were none left, the higher-ups forged the swords again to merge the twelve swords into two final ones before Origin and Finallity were forged together, creating the ""Humans (Acheron)"" who carried the collective memories of all life in Izumo and became ""beings higher than before."" that is the reason why Acheron always shed tears and having Overlapping memories every time she pulls her sword.  Before finally attacking the ""Blackhole"" with the sword of human, thrusting it into IX. The victors would return to nihility, and the defeated would become the nihility, it is certain that in the end, Yomi lost because if she won IX, it would have died, and Yomi would have risen as an AEON of nihility instead of IX. She even said that she will reach the nihility end. in Penacony 2.1 quest",53

3758,I’ve been saying this the whole time. Pax Dei looks like Conan exiles with way less to do. Like waaay less.,1
3759,Pax dei? DEI its marxist bs in the title,0
3760,"Problem with Pax Dei is that it MUST NOT BE too casual. The bulding is fun and although it's very fucking early in development, it's looks pretty fleshed out. But my point is that: Grandiose buildings must have a purpose. Like, why build a castle at all when just a simple house would suffice? Ok, style points, roleplaying, or just bursts of creativity might be a good excuse, but such a huge castle like the Asmon's community did needs to have like a functional purpose, and by that I mean raids. Pax Dei devs must think of a way to implement raiding/sieging bases that is not outright griefing or too hardcore like the ones in Rust. 

I for one like the drama that a total base destruction can provide like the wizard said, problem is that it's really not for everyone. But we can find a good middle ground where a base or a castle can be besieged and not totally destroyed. I think Pax Dei needs some form of natural PVP otherwise the game will get stale soon enough. PvE is great but it is predictable. Asmon said in his Pax Dei gameplay videos that some friction is good because friction equals tension, and without tension you can't have relief. You need tension for such a game to be worthwhile to play.",0
3761,"I am sure they will also have a shop where you can buy more inventory space bigger chests and advanced materials. I would prefer to pay a sub, and remove all those barriers they have created to ""force"" people buying the easy way out.",0

3770,"Beyond building a base with the barely basic parts what is left? I am wondering what they spent all the years in development doing? The assets are bought creatures, buildings, weapons, armor and so much more, there is no quest system, NPCs have no dialog of depth because there are none, there is no end game drive to PVP and it can not be the world at all, I have seen at least five videos that show you how to do it in UE 5 within two days and it would have rain snow and fog. Pax Dei is a very beautiful more shitty version of Valheim.

3783,Game is trash. Its worse that new world except you can build in a very limited bland way even if they add shit. Its not minecraft. Its just a halfass sandbox game hiding behind alpha status. Needs 5+ more years of dev time to be 5/10. The fuck were they doing all those years?,0
3784,"What worries me is, if you look up the company, they begun in 2019 (presumably with Pax Dei being their only product in the works) and they are 6 million € on the negative as of end of 2022 with 30 employees at that time. I can't find details about 2023/-24 on a glance.

If this alpha is what they've managed to create in 6 years with ""veterans from places like CCP, Next Games, Blizzard Entertainment, Ubisoft, and Remedy"" (from their linkedin page) and upwards from 6m€, then my assumption is the players can expect similar quality or worse than what these companies have produced recently.

I really hope I'm wrong and this actually turns out to be a superb game but at this time I refuse to put on my hype pants. The wizard appears very wise with his words of warning

Edit: Linkedin says they now have 76  employees and about 20 million us$ of funding (Dec 30, 2021)",0

Part of that is to help performance (less buildings = less work for the computer), but part of that is to help pad gameplay time (bonus: make balancing a bit easier). I saw this SO much with ""Dual Universe"" (although that one also had a subscription model, which that alone makes it terrible). It's like ""cool, I can build this and this and this!!!"" Game goes: ""heh, in a few months"". I HATE this so much. I get the reasons why, but doesn't change the fact that if you have a good build system, limiting it just feels... wrong.

3825,"The solution to people who like chaos vs people who enjoy building is you simply allow people to host their own servers and then they set the terms and rules, including what type of server it is. Full PVP, peaceful building, Role Play, X goal oriented, whatever. Point is that it would be easy to please everyone and give them what they want.",6
3826,"I can think of several ways to improve combat, one of which is adding shields if there aren't some already, and they should look at how other games have handled medieval melee combat. Something like dark souls combat could definitely work and while it isn't everyone's cup of tea, the style could be used as groundwork for adding unique combat features that lend itself to more realistic fighting. Adding weight and impact, knockback and invisible stunning gauges would already improve the experience. You could borrow how mount&blade / Bannerlord does melee on top of that by changing the type of attack based on the direction you attack with. Overhead swing, swipes, and a stab. Make heavy armor resistant to all the knockback and impact unless its a mace or hammer and you have yourself high level equipment to work towards too. All of the above is with them potentially adding PvP to the game at a later date. What the clan did is nothing short of building a kingdom. Now imagine there are several other clans that have done something similar, but now you are fighting over the same resources that have been tweaked to either not return or return very, very slowly. War it is. You can't build where others have placed ownership blocks, but you CAN destroy the block if you get inside. Destroy the fortress, wipe them out. The iron mine is now yours. 

Another scenario, the server is all role play with each their role, an actual player king and all. But you get exiled from the realm for reasons. Now you have to convince one of the other kingdoms to let you in. The guards won't let you in and you have no choice but to build a shack in the sticks. Some other players decided to become bandits. Poorly equipped bandits. Defend your one loaf of bread with your trusty woodcutting axe or join the merry band. Raid the castle dwellers and rob them when they exit. There's a lot of potential here for fun of they lean into it.",0

3884,Man I fucking love listening to the *WIZARD*,1
3885,They need a sort of conscription mechanic where you can spawn into an established guild.  Otherwise it's a super boring generic gathering thing.,1
3886,"Problem with full PvP destruction anywhere is that the game will be busy for the first 3 months, and then the population completely dies off. Has happened with every single MMO that went down that route. Whereas all the MMOs that have performed the best incorporate a lot of social min-maxing playstyles.

Also, I think people forget that Pax Dei is in early alpha lol. For the stage it is in, it runs reasonably well and yes there will be a lot of content missing because it's still being worked on. Aside from the F&F test, the first alpha invitational was purely to test the modular build system and nothing else. Then second alpha invitational was to stress test the servers and the layering.

Won't be everyone's kind of game and that's totally fine; not everybody likes COD and not everybody likes WoW. But the Devs have always been upfront that EA doesn't mean the game is leaving alpha, it's just an option for those who want to test a continuous version while the game is being developed. 
Game very easily has at least another 4 years of serious development before it starts taking shape anything remotely what the release version will be lol.",3

3921,"Wait, it says MMO, not MMORPG",0
3922,"Pax Dei should not be PVP focused. This game world is more filled than Conan Exiles so it may not be a great comparison.

In Conan Exiles most official or free servers are dominated by hackers and people who corner and wall off important parts of the map and try to extort dumb people to play the game and if you succeed against them in any way, they DDOS you and steal their stuff back from you. It's a nearly unclimbable wall. This also gets crazier since these people can migrate with most of what they have into another server and do the same thing.
If Pax Dei goes full PVP on all servers it will just end up that way too because even when Funcom treats hackers with a heavy hand, they are just back in again at some point.


In private or paid servers there is mostly RPing going on with negotiated PVP mixed in where both players or clans are aware and present to defend or fight, these servers also use a lot of mods.

PVP or PVP & PVE will always be a touchy subject because not everyone has the time especially now. You could be at work while someone across the world who just got home is raiding you and in my experience that caused quite a few new players to leave the servers. 
You could consolidate it to a specific time frame, but then that makes it to where only a set of people may play that server and may not get the large amount of people you expect on other servers and then the world just feels like a solo game.",0

Imagine a big AAA game studio telling us the game costs them years and hundreds million of dollars to make, but most of the budget went to near-realistic-cut-scene and ended up with such shitty ass gameplay that's copy-pasted from the older game. this is also why indie games are the hot nowadays, with new titles every month, and won't shy to experiment around, every now and then, releasing such a creative game.",0

It's such a time sink and you need a mega clan to be able to pump or craft anything.. as 3 person team it is very hard to play, however the game has promise, I like the mechanics, I like the fighting, there is a lot of protential and you can get magic in the future. Ya I am really hyped but at the same time my brain hurts from the grind. I never played a game like this that required this many resources.. though I believe that will be fixed as their playing the resources costs and all. first alpha was way too easy the second was WAYYYY too hard. Thats just my take on it. Honestly if this game turns more pvp heavy I am quitting. I don't want to play rust fantasy edition. I was happy it has areas for pvp.

this game needs more repeatable content instead of daily ECR grinds. Real raids with real dungeons instead of raid trials. updated trials actually worth doing, worm is useless, winter forge is useless after you get your artifact. more pvp variety, like new pvp game modes (CTF for example) with crossrealm compatibility and ranked modes right off the bat. remove the mutator restriction from 3 dungeons to mutate all dungeons. people are starved for things to do in endgame. fix the bugs and not introduce new bugs while fixing the old ones.",0

It's very skill based, skill as in not just your play skill but knowledge of the game and it's mechanics. Plus having player housing that you can build however you want and unlock items for your house through questing and the ESO store. There is A LOT of cosmetic monetization, that's the main downside to ESO. The game itself is really solid and it has a pretty large player base. The huge open world pvp battles are great.

Harvesting any resource and coming upon another player ruined gathering and crafting for me. Take a page out of ff14, have it so the resources exist for each player. Harvesting resources should have the potential to function like the chestruns do.

3.  Servers die, req paid transfer, rinse/repeat.

Is New World an open world PvP game or PvE?

It doesn’t feel good when your hard earned weapon that you use gets nerfed next patch because too many people cry about how strong it is.

Most people do not want to put a lot of time and effort or in game money into acquiring gear and then losing it within 10 minutes, and then having to acquire it all again, over and over. It gets old quick.

P. S. And I doubt console support will bring back many old players, so hopefully there's a lot more to be announced than that and a new pvp area (and swimming)....",0

4277,"OH cool PvP and console players. Sure makes me want to play this game again totally. This game failed the second they decided to start making the game as a PvP MMO. The PvP aspect of the game impacted the content for PvE, it also messes with the leveling experience and so on. The lack of travel was also a massive issue making you waste insane amounts of time every time you logged in turning a possible 2 hour a day play availability into 1 hour of travel and 1 hour of playtime. Its a horrible experience for anyone out side of those who have no job or personal life. 

Game was a failure the second they pivoted to try placate the PvE players. They noticed that the game would be no where near popular if it was just PVP (pvp audiences in MMO's as a whole don't even make up 10% of the playerbase of MMO's, even with ones with a heavy lean towards PvP, for example look at Guild wars, both games were heavy on the PvP being the core experience but both ended up making more PvE content than PvP content due to majority of the playerbase wanting PvE over PvP). The second they swapped they killed the game. They should have just stuck to the PvP game idea so it could die a faster death than this slow death they are experiencing with the current game they have. 

Let this game just be a warning to anyone making an MMO who wants huge amounts of their game to be orientated towards PvP. PvP should be a choice in a game as a fun mode to enjoy with others. It shouldn't be a core aspect of the game having it totally surrounding it.",0

The chance to get a drop on runescape or WOW is what keeps people coming back. It's such a fun feeling.",1

Proves that they have no clue.. 

Even if I wanted to come back to the game I would have to pay money for the last expansion just to experience a half functioning game that they have shown no interest in fixing, no thanks.",4

For example the crafting system, is kinda nice, but the shop and dugeons make the system kinda useless until you max level. Where you use it a little bit and then becomes kinda useless again. The dungeons are not bad, but you need to redo them until you go crazy, and just some dungeons are userfull, others you cant find players and maybe never gonna play. If you want a set to craft better items you need to farm a hidden especific mob like crazy to have a 1% chance to drop. They could drop that in the dungeon boses and make every dungeon userfull, but no, boses drop items that are just userfull in the level, but because you up like crazy the dungeon is useless. The combat also is not bad, but the one winning is the one who farmed all max level items, and to get the items you need to do the PVP, where you gonna die to the people who farmed the items",3

The game then changed to appease the banshees but it actually didn't which is what caused it's downfall.  I did a long forum post that outlined how this game would fail to which I was unceremoniously banned. I outlined taking an openworld PvP game where all it's mechanics and core files matched it's initial concept and simply spray painting ""PvE Themepark"" over it wouldn't do a thing besides ruin the experience for both communities.

Outpost rush was garbage so we went back to open world PvP.
We ran into a flagged player and could NOT kill them no matter what we did with our PvP build. They just stood there and healed. 2v1 we could not kill them. We even started talking to the guy and made friends WHILE WE WERE TRYING TO KILL HIM AND HE STOOD THERE.

4342,"The reason you gave for the game dying or the big reason why it died is right and wrong.  Yes it is a reason but not the big reason.  This game was due to fail before it came out.  The devs had never been devs in the position they where in, this is not normally an issue if you have 1 or 2 ppl like this, but it was EVERYONE.  Next the game came out and they did not have enough servers for everyone that got online, hell how long did you take and you are a streamer they should have been looking to make sure you where able to get online so while others where waiting to get in they could at least watch you play.  Then you have the end game... Chest runs... What a joke... And lets not even go over the game breaking bugs some of which are bugs that have been noted as far back as 2014, this points out once again how the devs where not seasoned enough for the job they where given.  Then you had the ban reports and no way to fight back to get your account unbanned.  That itself was a travesty.  If you pay money for something and a guild does not like you or you piss off one person and they have enough people to lie and report you and you have no way to fight back or even know what you are being charged with, well the levels of wrong that is on is enough to make people more then mad.  And lets not even cover the bots, once again you get mass reported and you get banned, while bots can keep doing what they do with NO ISSUES.  This game did look good and still looks good over all, but there are so many things wrong with it that it just needs to die and everyone that paid money should open a class action lawsuit to get back their money and more as they where sold a lie from the start.  This also hurts other games that come out as people will start to think ...Oh it is just going to be another New World game.  And that is a curse not a boon.",0
